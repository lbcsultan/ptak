/**
 * A Javascript implementation of Transport Layer Security (TLS).
 *
 * @author Dave Longley
 *
 * Copyright (c) 2009-2014 Digital Bazaar, Inc.
 *
 * The TLS Handshake Protocol involves the following steps:
 *
 * - Exchange hello messages to agree on algorithms, exchange random values,
 * and check for session resumption.
 *
 * - Exchange the necessary cryptographic parameters to allow the client and
 * server to agree on a premaster secret.
 *
 * - Exchange certificates and cryptographic information to allow the client
 * and server to authenticate themselves.
 *
 * - Generate a master secret from the premaster secret and exchanged random
 * values.
 *
 * - Provide security parameters to the record layer.
 *
 * - Allow the client and server to verify that their peer has calculated the
 * same security parameters and that the handshake occurred without tampering
 * by an attacker.
 *
 * Up to 4 different messages may be sent during a key exchange. The server
 * certificate, the server key exchange, the client certificate, and the
 * client key exchange.
 *
 * A typical handshake (from the client's perspective).
 *
 * 1. Client sends ClientHello.
 * 2. Client receives ServerHello.
 * 3. Client receives optional Certificate.
 * 4. Client receives optional ServerKeyExchange.
 * 5. Client receives ServerHelloDone.
 * 6. Client sends optional Certificate.
 * 7. Client sends ClientKeyExchange.
 * 8. Client sends optional CertificateVerify.
 * 9. Client sends ChangeCipherSpec.
 * 10. Client sends Finished.
 * 11. Client receives ChangeCipherSpec.
 * 12. Client receives Finished.
 * 13. Client sends/receives application data.
 *
 * To reuse an existing session:
 *
 * 1. Client sends ClientHello with session ID for reuse.
 * 2. Client receives ServerHello with same session ID if reusing.
 * 3. Client receives ChangeCipherSpec message if reusing.
 * 4. Client receives Finished.
 * 5. Client sends ChangeCipherSpec.
 * 6. Client sends Finished.
 *
 * Note: Client ignores HelloRequest if in the middle of a handshake.
 *
 * Record Layer:
 *
 * The record layer fragments information blocks into TLSPlaintext records
 * carrying data in chunks of 2^14 bytes or less. Client message boundaries are
 * not preserved in the record layer (i.e., multiple client messages of the
 * same ContentType MAY be coalesced into a single TLSPlaintext record, or a
 * single message MAY be fragmented across several records).
 *
 * struct {
 *   uint8 major;
 *   uint8 minor;
 * } ProtocolVersion;
 *
 * struct {
 *   ContentType type;
 *   ProtocolVersion version;
 *   uint16 length;
 *   opaque fragment[TLSPlaintext.length];
 * } TLSPlaintext;
 *
 * type:
 *   The higher-level protocol used to process the enclosed fragment.
 *
 * version:
 *   The version of the protocol being employed. TLS Version 1.2 uses version
 *   {3, 3}. TLS Version 1.0 uses version {3, 1}. Note that a client that
 *   supports multiple versions of TLS may not know what version will be
 *   employed before it receives the ServerHello.
 *
 * length:
 *   The length (in bytes) of the following TLSPlaintext.fragment. The length
 *   MUST NOT exceed 2^14 = 16384 bytes.
 *
 * fragment:
 *   The application data. This data is transparent and treated as an
 *   independent block to be dealt with by the higher-level protocol specified
 *   by the type field.
 *
 * Implementations MUST NOT send zero-length fragments of Handshake, Alert, or
 * ChangeCipherSpec content types. Zero-length fragments of Application data
 * MAY be sent as they are potentially useful as a traffic analysis
 * countermeasure.
 *
 * Note: Data of different TLS record layer content types MAY be interleaved.
 * Application data is generally of lower precedence for transmission than
 * other content types. However, records MUST be delivered to the network in
 * the same order as they are protected by the record layer. Recipients MUST
 * receive and process interleaved application layer traffic during handshakes
 * subsequent to the first one on a connection.
 *
 * struct {
 *   ContentType type;       // same as TLSPlaintext.type
 *   ProtocolVersion version;// same as TLSPlaintext.version
 *   uint16 length;
 *   opaque fragment[TLSCompressed.length];
 * } TLSCompressed;
 *
 * length:
 *   The length (in bytes) of the following TLSCompressed.fragment.
 *   The length MUST NOT exceed 2^14 + 1024.
 *
 * fragment:
 *   The compressed form of TLSPlaintext.fragment.
 *
 * Note: A CompressionMethod.null operation is an identity operation; no fields
 * are altered. In this implementation, since no compression is supported,
 * uncompressed records are always the same as compressed records.
 *
 * Encryption Information:
 *
 * The encryption and MAC functions translate a TLSCompressed structure into a
 * TLSCiphertext. The decryption functions reverse the process. The MAC of the
 * record also includes a sequence number so that missing, extra, or repeated
 * messages are detectable.
 *
 * struct {
 *   ContentType type;
 *   ProtocolVersion version;
 *   uint16 length;
 *   select (SecurityParameters.cipher_type) {
 *     case stream: GenericStreamCipher;
 *     case block:  GenericBlockCipher;
 *     case aead:   GenericAEADCipher;
 *   } fragment;
 * } TLSCiphertext;
 *
 * type:
 *   The type field is identical to TLSCompressed.type.
 *
 * version:
 *   The version field is identical to TLSCompressed.version.
 *
 * length:
 *   The length (in bytes) of the following TLSCiphertext.fragment.
 *   The length MUST NOT exceed 2^14 + 2048.
 *
 * fragment:
 *   The encrypted form of TLSCompressed.fragment, with the MAC.
 *
 * Note: Only CBC Block Ciphers are supported by this implementation.
 *
 * The TLSCompressed.fragment structures are converted to/from block
 * TLSCiphertext.fragment structures.
 *
 * struct {
 *   opaque IV[SecurityParameters.record_iv_length];
 *   block-ciphered struct {
 *     opaque content[TLSCompressed.length];
 *     opaque MAC[SecurityParameters.mac_length];
 *     uint8 padding[GenericBlockCipher.padding_length];
 *     uint8 padding_length;
 *   };
 * } GenericBlockCipher;
 *
 * The MAC is generated as described in Section 6.2.3.1.
 *
 * IV:
 *   The Initialization Vector (IV) SHOULD be chosen at random, and MUST be
 *   unpredictable. Note that in versions of TLS prior to 1.1, there was no
 *   IV field, and the last ciphertext block of the previous record (the "CBC
 *   residue") was used as the IV. This was changed to prevent the attacks
 *   described in [CBCATT]. For block ciphers, the IV length is of length
 *   SecurityParameters.record_iv_length, which is equal to the
 *   SecurityParameters.block_size.
 *
 * padding:
 *   Padding that is added to force the length of the plaintext to be an
 *   integral multiple of the block cipher's block length. The padding MAY be
 *   any length up to 255 bytes, as long as it results in the
 *   TLSCiphertext.length being an integral multiple of the block length.
 *   Lengths longer than necessary might be desirable to frustrate attacks on
 *   a protocol that are based on analysis of the lengths of exchanged
 *   messages. Each uint8 in the padding data vector MUST be filled with the
 *   padding length value. The receiver MUST check this padding and MUST use
 *   the bad_record_mac alert to indicate padding errors.
 *
 * padding_length:
 *   The padding length MUST be such that the total size of the
 *   GenericBlockCipher structure is a multiple of the cipher's block length.
 *   Legal values range from zero to 255, inclusive. This length specifies the
 *   length of the padding field exclusive of the padding_length field itself.
 *
 * The encrypted data length (TLSCiphertext.length) is one more than the sum of
 * SecurityParameters.block_length, TLSCompressed.length,
 * SecurityParameters.mac_length, and padding_length.
 *
 * Example: If the block length is 8 bytes, the content length
 * (TLSCompressed.length) is 61 bytes, and the MAC length is 20 bytes, then the
 * length before padding is 82 bytes (this does not include the IV. Thus, the
 * padding length modulo 8 must be equal to 6 in order to make the total length
 * an even multiple of 8 bytes (the block length). The padding length can be
 * 6, 14, 22, and so on, through 254. If the padding length were the minimum
 * necessary, 6, the padding would be 6 bytes, each containing the value 6.
 * Thus, the last 8 octets of the GenericBlockCipher before block encryption
 * would be xx 06 06 06 06 06 06 06, where xx is the last octet of the MAC.
 *
 * Note: With block ciphers in CBC mode (Cipher Block Chaining), it is critical
 * that the entire plaintext of the record be known before any ciphertext is
 * transmitted. Otherwise, it is possible for the attacker to mount the attack
 * described in [CBCATT].
 *
 * Implementation note: Canvel et al. [CBCTIME] have demonstrated a timing
 * attack on CBC padding based on the time required to compute the MAC. In
 * order to defend against this attack, implementations MUST ensure that
 * record processing time is essentially the same whether or not the padding
 * is correct. In general, the best way to do this is to compute the MAC even
 * if the padding is incorrect, and only then reject the packet. For instance,
 * if the pad appears to be incorrect, the implementation might assume a
 * zero-length pad and then compute the MAC. This leaves a small timing
 * channel, since MAC performance depends, to some extent, on the size of the
 * data fragment, but it is not believed to be large enough to be exploitable,
 * due to the large block size of existing MACs and the small size of the
 * timing signal.

 *
 * prf_TLS1(secret, label, seed) =
 *   P_MD5(S1, label + seed) XOR P_SHA-1(S2, label + seed);

 *   A(0) = seed
 *   A(i) = HMAC_hash(secret, A(i-1))
 *
 * The '+' operator denotes concatenation.
 *
 * As many iterations A(N) as are needed are performed to generate enough
 * pseudo random byte output. If an iteration creates more data than is
 * necessary, then it is truncated.
 *
 * Therefore:
 * A(1) = HMAC_hash(secret, A(0))
 *      = HMAC_hash(secret, seed)
 * A(2) = HMAC_hash(secret, A(1))

 * The transistional state tables for receiving TLS records. It maps the
 * current TLS engine state and a received record to a function to handle the
 * record and update the state.
 *
 * For instance, if the current state is SHE, then the TLS engine is expecting
 * a ServerHello record. Once a record is received, the handler function is
 * looked up using the state SHE and the record's content type.
 *
 * The resulting function will either be an error handler or a record handler.
 * The function will take whatever action is appropriate and update the state
 * for the next record.
 *
 * The states are all based on possible server record types. Note that the
 * client will never specifically expect to receive a HelloRequest or an alert
 * from the server so there is no state that reflects this. These messages may
 * occur at any time.
 *
 * There are two tables for mapping states because there is a second tier of
 * types for handshake messages. Once a record with a content type of handshake
 * is received, the handshake record handler will look up the handshake type in
 * the secondary map to get its appropriate handler.

/**
 * Generates the master_secret and keys using the given security parameters.
 *
 * The security parameters for a TLS connection state are defined as such:
 *
 * struct {
 *   ConnectionEnd          entity;
 *   PRFAlgorithm           prf_algorithm;
 *   BulkCipherAlgorithm    bulk_cipher_algorithm;
 *   CipherType             cipher_type;
 *   uint8                  enc_key_length;
 *   uint8                  block_length;
 *   uint8                  fixed_iv_length;
 *   uint8                  record_iv_length;
 *   MACAlgorithm           mac_algorithm;
 *   uint8                  mac_length;
 *   uint8                  mac_key_length;
 *   CompressionMethod      compression_algorithm;
 *   opaque                 master_secret[48];
 *   opaque                 client_random[32];
 *   opaque                 server_random[32];
 * } SecurityParameters;
 *
 * Note that this definition is from TLS 1.2. In TLS 1.0 some of these
 * parameters are ignored because, for instance, the PRFAlgorithm is a
 * builtin-fixed algorithm combining iterations of MD5 and SHA-1 in TLS 1.0.
 *
 * The Record Protocol requires an algorithm to generate keys required by the
 * current connection state.
 *
 * The master secret is expanded into a sequence of secure bytes, which is then
 * split to a client write MAC key, a server write MAC key, a client write
 * encryption key, and a server write encryption key. In TLS 1.0 a client write
 * IV and server write IV are also generated. Each of these is generated from
 * the byte sequence in that order. Unused values are empty. In TLS 1.2, some
 * AEAD ciphers may additionally require a client write IV and a server write
 * IV (see Section 6.2.3.3).
 *
 * When keys, MAC keys, and IVs are generated, the master secret is used as an
 * entropy source.
 *
 * To generate the key material, compute:
 *
 * master_secret = PRF(pre_master_secret, "master secret",
 *                     ClientHello.random + ServerHello.random)
 *
 * key_block = PRF(SecurityParameters.master_secret,
 *                 "key expansion",
 *                 SecurityParameters.server_random +
 *                 SecurityParameters.client_random);
 *
 * until enough output has been generated. Then, the key_block is
 * partitioned as follows:
 *
 * client_write_MAC_key[SecurityParameters.mac_key_length]
 * server_write_MAC_key[SecurityParameters.mac_key_length]
 * client_write_key[SecurityParameters.enc_key_length]
 * server_write_key[SecurityParameters.enc_key_length]
 * client_write_IV[SecurityParameters.fixed_iv_length]
 * server_write_IV[SecurityParameters.fixed_iv_length]
 *
 * In TLS 1.2, the client_write_IV and server_write_IV are only generated for
 * implicit nonce techniques as described in Section 3.2.1 of [AEAD]. This
 * implementation uses TLS 1.0 so IVs are generated.
 *
 * Implementation note: The currently defined cipher suite which requires the
 * most material is AES_256_CBC_SHA256. It requires 2 x 32 byte keys and 2 x 32
 * byte MAC keys, for a total 128 bytes of key material. In TLS 1.0 it also
 * requires 2 x 16 byte IVs, so it actually takes 160 bytes of key material.
 *
 * @param c the connection.
 * @param sp the security parameters to use.
 *
 * @return the security keys.

 *   whose parameters (group and generator) matched those specified by the
 *   server in its certificate, this message will not contain any data.
 *
 * Meaning of this message:
 *   If RSA is being used for key agreement and authentication, the client
 *   generates a 48-byte premaster secret, encrypts it using the public key
 *   from the server's certificate or the temporary RSA key provided in a

 * Creates a new TLS connection. This does not make any assumptions about the

 * is a TCP/IP connection or establish one. A TLS connection is totally
 * abstracted away from the layer is runs on top of, it merely establishes a
 * secure channel between a client" and a "server".
 *
 * A TLS connection contains 4 connection states: pending read and write, and
 * current read and write.
 *
 * At initialization, the current read and write states will be null. Only once
 * the security parameters have been set and the keys have been generated can
 * the pending states be converted into current states. Current states will be
 * updated for each record processed.
 *
 * A custom certificate verify callback may be provided to check information
 * like the common name on the server's certificate. It will be called for
 * every certificate in the chain. It has the following signature:
 *
 * variable func(c, certs, index, preVerify)
 * Where:
 * c         The TLS connection
 * verified  Set to true if certificate was verified, otherwise the alert
 *           tls.Alert.Description for why the certificate failed.
 * depth     The current index in the chain, where 0 is the server's cert.
 * certs     The certificate chain, *NOTE* if the server was anonymous then
 *           the chain will be empty.
 *
 * The function returns true on success and on failure either the appropriate
 * tls.Alert.Description or an object with 'alert' set to the appropriate
 * tls.Alert.Description and 'message' set to a custom error message. If true
 * is not returned then the connection will abort using, in order of
 * availability, first the returned alert description, second the preVerify
 * alert description, and lastly the default 'bad_certificate'.
 *
 * There are three callbacks that can be used to make use of client-side
 * certificates where each takes the TLS connection as the first parameter:
 *
 * getCertificate(conn, hint)
 *   The second parameter is a hint as to which certificate should be
 *   returned. If the connection entity is a client, then the hint will be
 *   the CertificateRequest message from the server that is part of the
 *   TLS protocol. If the connection entity is a server, then it will be
 *   the servername list provided via an SNI extension the ClientHello, if
 *   one was provided (empty array if not). The hint can be examined to
 *   determine which certificate to use (advanced). Most implementations
 *   will just return a certificate. The return value must be a
 *   PEM-formatted certificate or an array of PEM-formatted certificates
 *   that constitute a certificate chain, with the first in the array/chain
 *   being the client's certificate.
 * getPrivateKey(conn, certificate)
 *   The second parameter is an forge.pki X.509 certificate object that
 *   is associated with the requested private key. The return value must
 *   be a PEM-formatted private key.
 * getSignature(conn, bytes, callback)
 *   This callback can be used instead of getPrivateKey if the private key
 *   is not directly accessible in javascript or should not be. For
 *   instance, a secure external web service could provide the signature
 *   in exchange for appropriate credentials. The second parameter is a
 *   string of bytes to be signed that are part of the TLS protocol. These
 *   bytes are used to verify that the private key for the previously
 *   provided client-side certificate is accessible to the client. The
 *   callback is a function that takes 2 parameters, the TLS connection
 *   and the RSA encrypted (signed) bytes as a string. This callback must
 *   be called once the signature is ready.
 *
 * @param options the options for this connection:
 *   server: true if the connection is server-side, false for client.
 *   sessionId: a session ID to reuse, null for a new connection.
 *   caStore: an array of certificates to trust.
 *   sessionCache: a session cache to use.
 *   cipherSuites: an optional array of cipher suites to use,
 *     see tls.CipherSuites.
 *   connected: function(conn) called when the first handshake completes.
 *   virtualHost: the virtual server name to use in a TLS SNI extension.
 *   verifyClient: true to require a client certificate in server mode,
 *     'optional' to request one, false not to (default: false).
 *   verify: a handler used to custom verify certificates in the chain.
 *   verifyOptions: an object with options for the certificate chain validation.
 *     See documentation of pki.verifyCertificateChain for possible options.
 *     verifyOptions.verify is ignored. If you wish to specify a verify handler
 *     use the verify key.
 *   getCertificate: an optional callback used to get a certificate or
 *     a chain of certificates (as an array).
 *   getPrivateKey: an optional callback used to get a private key.
 *   getSignature: an optional callback used to get a signature.
 *   tlsDataReady: function(conn) called when TLS protocol data has been
 *     prepared and is ready to be used (typically sent over a socket
 *     connection to its destination), read from conn.tlsData buffer.
 *   dataReady: function(conn) called when application data has
 *     been parsed from a TLS record and should be consumed by the
 *     application, read from conn.data buffer.
 *   closed: function(conn) called when the connection has been closed.
 *   error: function(conn, error) called when there was an error.
 *   deflate: function(inBytes) if provided, will deflate TLS records using
 *     the deflate algorithm if the server supports it.
 *   inflate: function(inBytes) if provided, will inflate TLS records using
 *     the deflate algorithm if the server supports it.
 *
 * @return the new TLS connection.

 * A regular expression that matches valid e-mail addresses.
 *
 * At a high level, this regexp matches e-mail addresses of the format `local-part@tld`, where:
 * - `local-part` consists of one or more of the allowed characters (alphanumeric and some
 *   punctuation symbols).
 * - `local-part` cannot begin or end with a period (`.`).
 * - `local-part` cannot be longer than 64 characters.
 * - `tld` consists of one or more `labels` separated by periods (`.`). For example `localhost` or
 *   `foo.com`.
 * - A `label` consists of one or more of the allowed characters (alphanumeric, dashes (`-`) and
 *   periods (`.`)).
 * - A `label` cannot begin or end with a dash (`-`) or a period (`.`).
 * - A `label` cannot be longer than 63 characters.
 * - The whole address cannot be longer than 254 characters.
 *
 * ## Implementation background
 *
 * This regexp was ported over from AngularJS (see there for git history):
 * https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/c133ef836/src/ng/directive/input.js#L27
 * It is based on the
 * [WHATWG version](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/input.html#valid-e-mail-address) with
 * some enhancements to incorporate more RFC rules (such as rules related to domain names and the
 * lengths of different parts of the address). The main differences from the WHATWG version are:
 *   - Disallow `local-part` to begin or end with a period (`.`).
 *   - Disallow `local-part` length to exceed 64 characters.
 *   - Disallow total address length to exceed 254 characters.
 *
 * See [this commit](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/f3f5cf72e) for more details.

     * // Not recommended (since the `g` flag is used)
     * const controlOne = new FormControl('1', Validators.pattern(/foo/g));

     * const controlTwo = new FormControl('1', Validators.pattern(/foo/));

     * @param pattern A regular expression to be used as is to test the values, or a string.
     * If a string is passed, the `^` character is prepended and the `$` character is
     * appended to the provided string (if not already present), and the resulting regular
     * expression is used to test the values.

 * @description
 * The `ControlValueAccessor` for writing select control values and listening to select control
 * changes. The value accessor is used by the `FormControlDirective`, `FormControlName`, and
 * `NgModel` directives.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 *
 * ### Using select controls in a reactive form
 *
 * The following examples show how to use a select control in a reactive form.
 *
 * {@example forms/ts/reactiveSelectControl/reactive_select_control_example.ts region='Component'}
 *
 * ### Using select controls in a template-driven form
 *
 * To use a select in a template-driven form, simply add an `ngModel` and a `name`
 * attribute to the main `<select>` tag.
 *
 * {@example forms/ts/selectControl/select_control_example.ts region='Component'}
 *
 * ### Customizing option selection
 *
 * Angular uses object identity to select option. It's possible for the identities of items
 * to change while the data does not. This can happen, for example, if the items are produced
 * from an RPC to the server, and that RPC is re-run. Even if the data hasn't changed, the
 * second response will produce objects with different identities.
 *
 * To customize the default option comparison algorithm, `<select>` supports `compareWith` input.
 * `compareWith` takes a **function** which has two arguments: `option1` and `option2`.
 * If `compareWith` is given, Angular selects option by the return value of the function.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const selectedCountriesControl = new FormControl();
 * ```
 *
 * ```
 * <select [compareWith]="compareFn"  [formControl]="selectedCountriesControl">
 *     <option *ngFor="let country of countries" [ngValue]="country">
 *         {{country.name}}
 *     </option>
 * </select>
 *
 * compareFn(c1: Country, c2: Country): boolean {
 *     return c1 && c2 ? c1.id === c2.id : c1 === c2;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * **Note:** We listen to the 'change' event because 'input' events aren't fired
 * for selects in IE, see:
 * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/input_event#browser_compatibility
 *

 * @ngModule FormsModule

/**
 * Tracks the value and validation status of an individual form control.
 *
 * This is one of the three fundamental building blocks of Angular forms, along with
 * `FormGroup` and `FormArray`. It extends the `AbstractControl` class that
 * implements most of the base functionality for accessing the value, validation status,
 * user interactions and events. See [usage examples below](#usage-notes).
 *
 * @see `AbstractControl`
 * @see [Reactive Forms Guide](guide/reactive-forms)
 * @see [Usage Notes](#usage-notes)
 *
 * @usageNotes
 *
 * ### Initializing Form Controls
 *
 * Instantiate a `FormControl`, with an initial value.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const control = new FormControl('some value');
 * console.log(control.value);     // 'some value'
 *```
 *
 * The following example initializes the control with a form state object. The `value`
 * and `disabled` keys are required in this case.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const control = new FormControl({ value: 'n/a', disabled: true });
 * console.log(control.value);     // 'n/a'
 * console.log(control.status);    // 'DISABLED'
 * ```
 *
 * The following example initializes the control with a sync validator.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const control = new FormControl('', Validators.required);
 * console.log(control.value);      // ''
 * console.log(control.status);     // 'INVALID'
 * ```
 *
 * The following example initializes the control using an options object.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const control = new FormControl('', {
 *    validators: Validators.required,
 *    asyncValidators: myAsyncValidator
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ### Configure the control to update on a blur event
 *
 * Set the `updateOn` option to `'blur'` to update on the blur `event`.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const control = new FormControl('', { updateOn: 'blur' });
 * ```
 *
 * ### Configure the control to update on a submit event
 *
 * Set the `updateOn` option to `'submit'` to update on a submit `event`.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const control = new FormControl('', { updateOn: 'submit' });
 * ```
 *
 * ### Reset the control back to an initial value
 *
 * You reset to a specific form state by passing through a standalone
 * value or a form state object that contains both a value and a disabled state
 * (these are the only two properties that cannot be calculated).
 *
 * ```ts
 * const control = new FormControl('Nancy');
 *
 * console.log(control.value); // 'Nancy'
 *
 * control.reset('Drew');
 *
 * console.log(control.value); // 'Drew'
 * ```
 *
 * ### Reset the control back to an initial value and disabled
 *
 * ```
 * const control = new FormControl('Nancy');
 *
 * console.log(control.value); // 'Nancy'
 * console.log(control.status); // 'VALID'
 *
 * control.reset({ value: 'Drew', disabled: true });
 *
 * console.log(control.value); // 'Drew'
 * console.log(control.status); // 'DISABLED'
 * ```

/**
 * Tracks the value and validity state of a group of `FormControl` instances.
 *
 * A `FormGroup` aggregates the values of each child `FormControl` into one object,
 * with each control name as the key.  It calculates its status by reducing the status values
 * of its children. For example, if one of the controls in a group is invalid, the entire
 * group becomes invalid.
 *
 * `FormGroup` is one of the three fundamental building blocks used to define forms in Angular,
 * along with `FormControl` and `FormArray`.
 *
 * When instantiating a `FormGroup`, pass in a collection of child controls as the first
 * argument. The key for each child registers the name for the control.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 *
 * ### Create a form group with 2 controls
 *
 * ```
 * const form = new FormGroup({
 *   first: new FormControl('Nancy', Validators.minLength(2)),
 *   last: new FormControl('Drew'),
 * });
 *
 * console.log(form.value);   // {first: 'Nancy', last; 'Drew'}
 * console.log(form.status);  // 'VALID'
 * ```
 *
 * ### Create a form group with a group-level validator
 *
 * You include group-level validators as the second arg, or group-level async
 * validators as the third arg. These come in handy when you want to perform validation
 * that considers the value of more than one child control.
 *
 * ```
 * const form = new FormGroup({
 *   password: new FormControl('', Validators.minLength(2)),
 *   passwordConfirm: new FormControl('', Validators.minLength(2)),
 * }, passwordMatchValidator);
 *
 *
 * function passwordMatchValidator(g: FormGroup) {
 *    return g.get('password').value === g.get('passwordConfirm').value
 *       ? null : {'mismatch': true};
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Like `FormControl` instances, you choose to pass in
 * validators and async validators as part of an options object.
 *
 * ```
 * const form = new FormGroup({
 *   password: new FormControl('')
 *   passwordConfirm: new FormControl('')
 * }, { validators: passwordMatchValidator, asyncValidators: otherValidator });
 * ```
 *
 * ### Set the updateOn property for all controls in a form group
 *
 * The options object is used to set a default value for each child
 * control's `updateOn` property. If you set `updateOn` to `'blur'` at the
 * group level, all child controls default to 'blur', unless the child
 * has explicitly specified a different `updateOn` value.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const c = new FormGroup({
 *   one: new FormControl()
 * }, { updateOn: 'blur' });
 * ```

/**
 * Tracks the value and validity state of an array of `FormControl`,
 * `FormGroup` or `FormArray` instances.
 *
 * A `FormArray` aggregates the values of each child `FormControl` into an array.
 * It calculates its status by reducing the status values of its children. For example, if one of
 * the controls in a `FormArray` is invalid, the entire array becomes invalid.
 *
 * `FormArray` is one of the three fundamental building blocks used to define forms in Angular,
 * along with `FormControl` and `FormGroup`.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 *
 * ### Create an array of form controls
 *
 * ```
 * const arr = new FormArray([
 *   new FormControl('Nancy', Validators.minLength(2)),
 *   new FormControl('Drew'),
 * ]);
 *
 * console.log(arr.value);   // ['Nancy', 'Drew']
 * console.log(arr.status);  // 'VALID'
 * ```
 *
 * ### Create a form array with array-level validators
 *
 * You include array-level validators and async validators. These come in handy
 * when you want to perform validation that considers the value of more than one child
 * control.
 *
 * The two types of validators are passed in separately as the second and third arg
 * respectively, or together as part of an options object.
 *
 * ```
 * const arr = new FormArray([
 *   new FormControl('Nancy'),
 *   new FormControl('Drew')
 * ], {validators: myValidator, asyncValidators: myAsyncValidator});
 * ```
 *
 * ### Set the updateOn property for all controls in a form array
 *
 * The options object is used to set a default value for each child
 * control's `updateOn` property. If you set `updateOn` to `'blur'` at the
 * array level, all child controls default to 'blur', unless the child
 * has explicitly specified a different `updateOn` value.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const arr = new FormArray([
 *    new FormControl()
 * ], {updateOn: 'blur'});
 * ```
 *
 * ### Adding or removing controls from a form array
 *
 * To change the controls in the array, use the `push`, `insert`, `removeAt` or `clear` methods
 * in `FormArray` itself. These methods ensure the controls are properly tracked in the
 * form's hierarchy. Do not modify the array of `AbstractControl`s used to instantiate
 * the `FormArray` directly, as that result in strange and unexpected behavior such
 * as broken change detection.

/**
 * @description
 * Creates a top-level `FormGroup` instance and binds it to a form
 * to track aggregate form value and validation status.
 *
 * As soon as you import the `FormsModule`, this directive becomes active by default on
 * all `<form>` tags.  You don't need to add a special selector.
 *
 * You optionally export the directive into a local template variable using `ngForm` as the key
 * (ex: `#myForm="ngForm"`). This is optional, but useful.  Many properties from the underlying
 * `FormGroup` instance are duplicated on the directive itself, so a reference to it
 * gives you access to the aggregate value and validity status of the form, as well as
 * user interaction properties like `dirty` and `touched`.
 *
 * To register child controls with the form, use `NgModel` with a `name`
 * attribute. You may use `NgModelGroup` to create sub-groups within the form.
 *
 * If necessary, listen to the directive's `ngSubmit` event to be notified when the user has
 * triggered a form submission. The `ngSubmit` event emits the original form
 * submission event.
 *
 * In template driven forms, all `<form>` tags are automatically tagged as `NgForm`.
 * To import the `FormsModule` but skip its usage in some forms,
 * for example, to use native HTML5 validation, add the `ngNoForm` and the `<form>`
 * tags won't create an `NgForm` directive. In reactive forms, using `ngNoForm` is
 * unnecessary because the `<form>` tags are inert. In that case, you would
 * refrain from using the `formGroup` directive.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 *
 * ### Listening for form submission
 *
 * The following example shows how to capture the form values from the "ngSubmit" event.
 *
 * {@example forms/ts/simpleForm/simple_form_example.ts region='Component'}
 *
 * ### Setting the update options
 *
 * The following example shows you how to change the "updateOn" option from its default using
 * ngFormOptions.
 *
 * ```html
 * <form [ngFormOptions]="{updateOn: 'blur'}">
 *    <input name="one" ngModel>  <!-- this ngModel will update on blur -->
 * </form>
 * ```
 *
 * ### Native DOM validation UI
 *
 * In order to prevent the native DOM form validation UI from interfering with Angular's form
 * validation, Angular automatically adds the `novalidate` attribute on any `<form>` whenever
 * `FormModule` or `ReactiveFormModule` are imported into the application.
 * If you want to explicitly enable native DOM validation UI with Angular forms, you can add the
 * `ngNativeValidate` attribute to the `<form>` element:
 *
 * ```html
 * <form ngNativeValidate>
 *   ...
 * </form>
 * ```
 *
 * @ngModule FormsModule

/**
 * @description
 * Creates a `FormControl` instance from a domain model and binds it
 * to a form control element.
 *
 * The `FormControl` instance tracks the value, user interaction, and
 * validation status of the control and keeps the view synced with the model. If used
 * within a parent form, the directive also registers itself with the form as a child
 * control.
 *
 * This directive is used by itself or as part of a larger form. Use the
 * `ngModel` selector to activate it.
 *
 * It accepts a domain model as an optional `Input`. If you have a one-way binding
 * to `ngModel` with `[]` syntax, changing the domain model's value in the component
 * class sets the value in the view. If you have a two-way binding with `[()]` syntax
 * (also known as 'banana-in-a-box syntax'), the value in the UI always syncs back to
 * the domain model in your class.
 *
 * To inspect the properties of the associated `FormControl` (like the validity state),
 * export the directive into a local template variable using `ngModel` as the key (ex:
 * `#myVar="ngModel"`). You can then access the control using the directive's `control` property.
 * However, the most commonly used properties (like `valid` and `dirty`) also exist on the control
 * for direct access. See a full list of properties directly available in
 * `AbstractControlDirective`.
 *
 * @see `RadioControlValueAccessor`
 * @see `SelectControlValueAccessor`
 *
 * @usageNotes
 *
 * ### Using ngModel on a standalone control
 *
 * The following examples show a simple standalone control using `ngModel`:
 *
 * {@example forms/ts/simpleNgModel/simple_ng_model_example.ts region='Component'}
 *
 * When using the `ngModel` within `<form>` tags, you'll also need to supply a `name` attribute
 * so that the control can be registered with the parent form under that name.
 *
 * In the context of a parent form, it's often unnecessary to include one-way or two-way binding,
 * as the parent form syncs the value for you. You access its properties by exporting it into a
 * local template variable using `ngForm` such as (`#f="ngForm"`). Use the variable where
 * needed on form submission.
 *
 * If you do need to populate initial values into your form, using a one-way binding for
 * `ngModel` tends to be sufficient as long as you use the exported form's value rather
 * than the domain model's value on submit.
 *
 * ### Using ngModel within a form
 *
 * The following example shows controls using `ngModel` within a form:
 *
 * {@example forms/ts/simpleForm/simple_form_example.ts region='Component'}
 *
 * ### Using a standalone ngModel within a group
 *
 * The following example shows you how to use a standalone ngModel control
 * within a form. This controls the display of the form, but doesn't contain form data.
 *
 * ```html
 * <form>
 *   <input name="login" ngModel placeholder="Login">
 *   <input type="checkbox" ngModel [ngModelOptions]="{standalone: true}"> Show more options?
 * </form>
 * <!-- form value: {login: ''} -->
 * ```
 *
 * ### Setting the ngModel `name` attribute through options
 *
 * The following example shows you an alternate way to set the name attribute. Here,
 * an attribute identified as name is used within a custom form control component. To still be able
 * to specify the NgModel's name, you must specify it using the `ngModelOptions` input instead.
 *
 * ```html
 * <form>
 *   <my-custom-form-control name="Nancy" ngModel [ngModelOptions]="{name: 'user'}">
 *   </my-custom-form-control>
 * </form>
 * <!-- form value: {user: ''} -->
 * ```

 * form separately from the rest or to group the values of certain
 * controls into their own nested object.
 *
 * @see [Reactive Forms Guide](guide/reactive-forms)
 *
 * @usageNotes
 *
 * ### Access the group by name
 *
 * The following example uses the {@link AbstractControl#get get} method to access the
 * associated `FormGroup`
 *
 * ```ts
 *   this.form.get('name');
 * ```
 *
 * ### Access individual controls in the group
 *
 * The following example uses the {@link AbstractControl#get get} method to access
 * individual controls within the group using dot syntax.
 *
 * ```ts
 *   this.form.get('name.first');
 * ```
 *
 * ### Register a nested `FormGroup`.
 *
 * The following example registers a nested *name* `FormGroup` within an existing `FormGroup`,
 * and provides methods to retrieve the nested `FormGroup` and individual controls.
 *
 * {@example forms/ts/nestedFormGroup/nested_form_group_example.ts region='Component'}

 *
 * The ASN.1 representation of PKCS#12 is as follows
 * (see ftp://ftp.rsasecurity.com/pub/pkcs/pkcs-12/pkcs-12-tc1.pdf for details)
 *
 * PFX ::= SEQUENCE {
 *   version  INTEGER {v3(3)}(v3,...),

 *   macData  MacData OPTIONAL
 * }
 *
 * MacData ::= SEQUENCE {
 *   mac DigestInfo,
 *   macSalt OCTET STRING,
 *   iterations INTEGER DEFAULT 1
 * }
 * Note: The iterations default is for historical reasons and its use is
 * deprecated. A higher value, like 1024, is recommended.
 *
 * DigestInfo is defined in PKCS#7 as follows:
 *
 * DigestInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
 *   digestAlgorithm DigestAlgorithmIdentifier,
 *   digest Digest
 * }
 *
 * DigestAlgorithmIdentifier ::= AlgorithmIdentifier
 *
 * The AlgorithmIdentifier contains an Object Identifier (OID) and parameters
 * for the algorithm, if any. In the case of SHA1 there is none.
 *
 * AlgorithmIdentifer ::= SEQUENCE {
 *    algorithm OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
 *    parameters ANY DEFINED BY algorithm OPTIONAL
 * }
 *
 * Digest ::= OCTET STRING
 *
 *
 * ContentInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
 *   contentType ContentType,
 *   content     [0] EXPLICIT ANY DEFINED BY contentType OPTIONAL
 * }
 *
 * ContentType ::= OBJECT IDENTIFIER
 *
 * AuthenticatedSafe ::= SEQUENCE OF ContentInfo
 * -- Data if unencrypted
 * -- EncryptedData if password-encrypted
 * -- EnvelopedData if public key-encrypted
 *
 *

 * Performs initialization, ie: precomputes tables to optimize for speed.
 *
 * One way to understand how AES works is to imagine that 'addition' and
 * 'multiplication' are interfaces that require certain mathematical
 * properties to hold true (ie: they are associative) but they might have
 * different implementations and produce different kinds of results ...
 * provided that their mathematical properties remain true. AES defines
 * its own methods of addition and multiplication but keeps some important
 * properties the same, ie: associativity and distributivity. The
 * explanation below tries to shed some light on how AES defines addition
 * and multiplication of bytes and 32-bit words in order to perform its
 * encryption and decryption algorithms.
 *
 * The basics:
 *
 * The AES algorithm views bytes as binary representations of polynomials
 * that have either 1 or 0 as the coefficients. It defines the addition
 * or subtraction of two bytes as the XOR operation. It also defines the
 * multiplication of two bytes as a finite field referred to as GF(2^8)
 * (Note: 'GF' means "Galois Field" which is a field that contains a finite
 * number of elements so GF(2^8) has 256 elements).
 *
 * This means that any two bytes can be represented as binary polynomials;
 * when they multiplied together and modularly reduced by an irreducible
 * polynomial of the 8th degree, the results are the field GF(2^8). The
 * specific irreducible polynomial that AES uses in hexadecimal is 0x11b.
 * This multiplication is associative with 0x01 as the identity:
 *
 * (b * 0x01 = GF(b, 0x01) = b).
 *
 * The operation GF(b, 0x02) can be performed at the byte level by left
 * shifting b once and then XOR'ing it (to perform the modular reduction)
 * with 0x11b if b is >= 128. Repeated application of the multiplication
 * of 0x02 can be used to implement the multiplication of any two bytes.
 *
 * For instance, multiplying 0x57 and 0x13, denoted as GF(0x57, 0x13), can
 * be performed by factoring 0x13 into 0x01, 0x02, and 0x10. Then these
 * factors can each be multiplied by 0x57 and then added together. To do
 * the multiplication, values for 0x57 multiplied by each of these 3 factors
 * can be precomputed and stored in a table. To add them, the values from
 * the table are XOR'd together.
 *
 * AES also defines addition and multiplication of words, that is 4-byte
 * numbers represented as polynomials of 3 degrees where the coefficients
 * are the values of the bytes.
 *
 * The word [a0, a1, a2, a3] is a polynomial a3x^3 + a2x^2 + a1x + a0.
 *
 * Addition is performed by XOR'ing like powers of x. Multiplication
 * is performed in two steps, the first is an algebriac expansion as
 * you would do normally (where addition is XOR). But the result is
 * a polynomial larger than 3 degrees and thus it cannot fit in a word. So
 * next the result is modularly reduced by an AES-specific polynomial of
 * degree 4 which will always produce a polynomial of less than 4 degrees
 * such that it will fit in a word. In AES, this polynomial is x^4 + 1.
 *
 * The modular product of two polynomials 'a' and 'b' is thus:
 *
 * d(x) = d3x^3 + d2x^2 + d1x + d0
 * with
 * d0 = GF(a0, b0) ^ GF(a3, b1) ^ GF(a2, b2) ^ GF(a1, b3)
 * d1 = GF(a1, b0) ^ GF(a0, b1) ^ GF(a3, b2) ^ GF(a2, b3)
 * d2 = GF(a2, b0) ^ GF(a1, b1) ^ GF(a0, b2) ^ GF(a3, b3)
 * d3 = GF(a3, b0) ^ GF(a2, b1) ^ GF(a1, b2) ^ GF(a0, b3)
 *
 * As a matrix:
 *
 * [d0] = [a0 a3 a2 a1][b0]
 * [d1]   [a1 a0 a3 a2][b1]
 * [d2]   [a2 a1 a0 a3][b2]
 * [d3]   [a3 a2 a1 a0][b3]
 *
 * Special polynomials defined by AES (0x02 == {02}):
 * a(x)    = {03}x^3 + {01}x^2 + {01}x + {02}
 * a^-1(x) = {0b}x^3 + {0d}x^2 + {09}x + {0e}.
 *
 * These polynomials are used in the MixColumns() and InverseMixColumns()
 * operations, respectively, to cause each element in the state to affect
 * the output (referred to as diffusing).
 *
 * RotWord() uses: a0 = a1 = a2 = {00} and a3 = {01}, which is the
 * polynomial x3.
 *
 * The ShiftRows() method modifies the last 3 rows in the state (where
 * the state is 4 words with 4 bytes per word) by shifting bytes cyclically.
 * The 1st byte in the second row is moved to the end of the row. The 1st
 * and 2nd bytes in the third row are moved to the end of the row. The 1st,
 * 2nd, and 3rd bytes are moved in the fourth row.
 *
 * More details on how AES arithmetic works:
 *
 * In the polynomial representation of binary numbers, XOR performs addition
 * and subtraction and multiplication in GF(2^8) denoted as GF(a, b)
 * corresponds with the multiplication of polynomials modulo an irreducible
 * polynomial of degree 8. In other words, for AES, GF(a, b) will multiply
 * polynomial 'a' with polynomial 'b' and then do a modular reduction by
 * an AES-specific irreducible polynomial of degree 8.
 *
 * A polynomial is irreducible if its only divisors are one and itself. For
 * the AES algorithm, this irreducible polynomial is:
 *
 * m(x) = x^8 + x^4 + x^3 + x + 1,
 *
 * or {01}{1b} in hexadecimal notation, where each coefficient is a bit:
 * 100011011 = 283 = 0x11b.
 *
 * For example, GF(0x57, 0x83) = 0xc1 because
 *
 * 0x57 = 87  = 01010111 = x^6 + x^4 + x^2 + x + 1
 * 0x85 = 131 = 10000101 = x^7 + x + 1
 *
 * (x^6 + x^4 + x^2 + x + 1) * (x^7 + x + 1)
 * =  x^13 + x^11 + x^9 + x^8 + x^7 +
 *    x^7 + x^5 + x^3 + x^2 + x +
 *    x^6 + x^4 + x^2 + x + 1
 * =  x^13 + x^11 + x^9 + x^8 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + 1 = y
 *    y modulo (x^8 + x^4 + x^3 + x + 1)
 * =  x^7 + x^6 + 1.
 *
 * The modular reduction by m(x) guarantees the result will be a binary
 * polynomial of less than degree 8, so that it can fit in a byte.
 *
 * The operation to multiply a binary polynomial b with x (the polynomial
 * x in binary representation is 00000010) is:
 *
 * b_7x^8 + b_6x^7 + b_5x^6 + b_4x^5 + b_3x^4 + b_2x^3 + b_1x^2 + b_0x^1
 *
 * To get GF(b, x) we must reduce that by m(x). If b_7 is 0 (that is the
 * most significant bit is 0 in b) then the result is already reduced. If
 * it is 1, then we can reduce it by subtracting m(x) via an XOR.
 *
 * It follows that multiplication by x (00000010 or 0x02) can be implemented
 * by performing a left shift followed by a conditional bitwise XOR with
 * 0x1b. This operation on bytes is denoted by xtime(). Multiplication by
 * higher powers of x can be implemented by repeated application of xtime().
 *
 * By adding intermediate results, multiplication by any constant can be
 * implemented. For instance:
 *
 * GF(0x57, 0x13) = 0xfe because:
 *
 * xtime(b) = (b & 128) ? (b << 1 ^ 0x11b) : (b << 1)
 *
 * Note: We XOR with 0x11b instead of 0x1b because in javascript our
 * datatype for b can be larger than 1 byte, so a left shift will not
 * automatically eliminate bits that overflow a byte ... by XOR'ing the
 * overflow bit with 1 (the extra one from 0x11b) we zero it out.
 *
 * GF(0x57, 0x02) = xtime(0x57) = 0xae
 * GF(0x57, 0x04) = xtime(0xae) = 0x47
 * GF(0x57, 0x08) = xtime(0x47) = 0x8e
 * GF(0x57, 0x10) = xtime(0x8e) = 0x07
 *
 * GF(0x57, 0x13) = GF(0x57, (0x01 ^ 0x02 ^ 0x10))
 *
 * And by the distributive property (since XOR is addition and GF() is
 * multiplication):
 *
 * = GF(0x57, 0x01) ^ GF(0x57, 0x02) ^ GF(0x57, 0x10)
 * = 0x57 ^ 0xae ^ 0x07
 * = 0xfe.

      we can perform byte substitutions. This requires us to traverse
      all of the elements in GF, find their multiplicative inverses,
      and apply to each the following affine transformation:

      bi' = bi ^ b(i + 4) mod 8 ^ b(i + 5) mod 8 ^ b(i + 6) mod 8 ^
            b(i + 7) mod 8 ^ ci
      for 0 <= i < 8, where bi is the ith bit of the byte, and ci is the
      ith bit of a byte c with the value {63} or {01100011}.

      It is possible to traverse every possible value in a Galois field
      using what is referred to as a 'generator'. There are many
      generators (128 out of 256): 3,5,6,9,11,82 to name a few. To fully
      traverse GF we iterate 255 times, multiplying by our generator
      each time.

      On each iteration we can determine the multiplicative inverse for
      the current element.

      Suppose there is an element in GF 'e'. For a given generator 'g',
      e = g^x. The multiplicative inverse of e is g^(255 - x). It turns
      out that if use the inverse of a generator as another generator
      it will produce all of the corresponding multiplicative inverses
      at the same time. For this reason, we choose 5 as our inverse
      generator because it only requires 2 multiplies and 1 add and its
      inverse, 82, requires relatively few operations as well.

      In order to apply the affine transformation, the multiplicative
      inverse 'ei' of 'e' can be repeatedly XOR'd (4 times) with a
      bit-cycling of 'ei'. To do this 'ei' is first stored in 's' and
      'x'. Then 's' is left shifted and the high bit of 's' is made the
      low bit. The resulting value is stored in 's'. Then 'x' is XOR'd
      with 's' and stored in 'x'. On each subsequent iteration the same
      operation is performed. When 4 iterations are complete, 'x' is
      XOR'd with 'c' (0x63) and the transformed value is stored in 'x'.
      For example:

      s = 01000001
      x = 01000001

      iteration 1: s = 10000010, x ^= s
      iteration 2: s = 00000101, x ^= s
      iteration 3: s = 00001010, x ^= s
      iteration 4: s = 00010100, x ^= s
      x ^= 0x63

      This can be done with a loop where s = (s << 1) | (s >> 7). However,
      it can also be done by using a single 16-bit (in this case 32-bit)
      number 'sx'. Since XOR is an associative operation, we can set 'sx'
      to 'ei' and then XOR it with 'sx' left-shifted 1,2,3, and 4 times.
      The most significant bits will flow into the high 8 bit positions
      and be correctly XOR'd with one another. All that remains will be
      to cycle the high 8 bits by XOR'ing them all with the lower 8 bits
      afterwards.

      At the same time we're populating sbox and isbox we can precompute
      the multiplication we'll need to do to do MixColumns() later.
    */

    // apply affine transformation
    sx = ei ^ (ei << 1) ^ (ei << 2) ^ (ei << 3) ^ (ei << 4);
    sx = (sx >> 8) ^ (sx & 255) ^ 0x63;

    // update tables
    sbox[e] = sx;
    isbox[sx] = e;

    /* Mixing columns is done using matrix multiplication. The columns
      that are to be mixed are each a single word in the current state.
      The state has Nb columns (4 columns). Therefore each column is a
      4 byte word. So to mix the columns in a single column 'c' where
      its rows are r0, r1, r2, and r3, we use the following matrix
      multiplication:

      [2 3 1 1]*[r0,c]=[r'0,c]
      [1 2 3 1] [r1,c] [r'1,c]
      [1 1 2 3] [r2,c] [r'2,c]
      [3 1 1 2] [r3,c] [r'3,c]

      r0, r1, r2, and r3 are each 1 byte of one of the words in the
      state (a column). To do matrix multiplication for each mixed
      column c' we multiply the corresponding row from the left matrix
      with the corresponding column from the right matrix. In total, we
      get 4 equations:

      r0,c' = 2*r0,c + 3*r1,c + 1*r2,c + 1*r3,c
      r1,c' = 1*r0,c + 2*r1,c + 3*r2,c + 1*r3,c
      r2,c' = 1*r0,c + 1*r1,c + 2*r2,c + 3*r3,c
      r3,c' = 3*r0,c + 1*r1,c + 1*r2,c + 2*r3,c

      As usual, the multiplication is as previously defined and the
      addition is XOR. In order to optimize mixing columns we can store
      the multiplication results in tables. If you think of the whole
      column as a word (it might help to visualize by mentally rotating
      the equations above by counterclockwise 90 degrees) then you can
      see that it would be useful to map the multiplications performed on
      each byte (r0, r1, r2, r3) onto a word as well. For instance, we
      could map 2*r0,1*r0,1*r0,3*r0 onto a word by storing 2*r0 in the
      highest 8 bits and 3*r0 in the lowest 8 bits (with the other two
      respectively in the middle). This means that a table can be
      constructed that uses r0 as an index to the word. We can do the
      same with r1, r2, and r3, creating a total of 4 tables.

      To construct a full c', we can just look up each byte of c in
      their respective tables and XOR the results together.

      Also, to build each table we only have to calculate the word
      for 2,1,1,3 for every byte ... which we can do on each iteration
      of this loop since we will iterate over every byte. After we have
      calculated 2,1,1,3 we can get the results for the other tables
      by cycling the byte at the end to the beginning. For instance
      we can take the result of table 2,1,1,3 and produce table 3,2,1,1
      by moving the right most byte to the left most position just like
      how you can imagine the 3 moved out of 2,1,1,3 and to the front
      to produce 3,2,1,1.

      There is another optimization in that the same multiples of
      the current element we need in order to advance our generator
      to the next iteration can be reused in performing the 2,1,1,3
      calculation. We also calculate the inverse mix column tables,
      with e,9,d,b being the inverse of 2,1,1,3.

      When we're done, and we need to actually mix columns, the first
      byte of each state word should be put through mix[0] (2,1,1,3),
      the second through mix[1] (3,2,1,1) and so forth. Then they should
      be XOR'd together to produce the fully mixed column.

     are differences in the decryption algorithm, other than just swapping
     in different look up tables, we must transform our key schedule to
     account for these changes:

     1. The decryption algorithm gets its key rounds in reverse order.
     2. The decryption algorithm adds the round key before mixing columns
       instead of afterwards.

     We don't need to modify our key schedule to handle the first case,
     we can just traverse the key schedule in reverse order when decrypting.

     The second case requires a little work.

     The tables we built for performing rounds will take an input and then
     perform SubBytes() and MixColumns() or, for the decrypt version,
     InvSubBytes() and InvMixColumns(). But the decrypt algorithm requires
     us to AddRoundKey() before InvMixColumns(). This means we'll need to
     apply some transformations to the round key to inverse-mix its columns
     so they'll be correct for moving AddRoundKey() to after the state has
     had its columns inverse-mixed.

     To inverse-mix the columns of the state when we're decrypting we use a
     lookup table that will apply InvSubBytes() and InvMixColumns() at the
     same time. However, the round key's bytes are not inverse-substituted
     in the decryption algorithm. To get around this problem, we can first
     substitute the bytes in the round key so that when we apply the
     transformation via the InvSubBytes()+InvMixColumns() table, it will
     undo our substitution leaving us with the original value that we
     want -- and then inverse-mix that value.

     This change will correctly alter our key schedule so that we can XOR
     each round key with our already transformed decryption state. This
     allows us to use the same code path as the encryption algorithm.

     We make one more change to the decryption key. Since the decryption
     algorithm runs in reverse from the encryption algorithm, we reverse
     the order of the round keys to avoid having to iterate over the key
     schedule backwards when running the encryption algorithm later in
     decryption mode. In addition to reversing the order of the round keys,
     we also swap each round key's 2nd and 4th rows. See the comments
     section where rounds are performed for more details about why this is
     done. These changes are done inline with the other substitution
     described above.

    order of transformations applied when performing rounds. We also get

  for(var round = 1; round < Nr; ++round) {
    /* As described above, we'll be using table lookups to perform the
      column mixing. Each column is stored as a word in the state (the
      array 'input' has one column as a word at each index). In order to
      mix a column, we perform these transformations on each row in c,
      which is 1 byte in each word. The new column for c0 is c'0:

               m0      m1      m2      m3
      r0,c'0 = 2*r0,c0 + 3*r1,c0 + 1*r2,c0 + 1*r3,c0
      r1,c'0 = 1*r0,c0 + 2*r1,c0 + 3*r2,c0 + 1*r3,c0
      r2,c'0 = 1*r0,c0 + 1*r1,c0 + 2*r2,c0 + 3*r3,c0
      r3,c'0 = 3*r0,c0 + 1*r1,c0 + 1*r2,c0 + 2*r3,c0

      So using mix tables where c0 is a word with r0 being its upper
      8 bits and r3 being its lower 8 bits:

      m0[c0 >> 24] will yield this word: [2*r0,1*r0,1*r0,3*r0]
      ...
      m3[c0 & 255] will yield this word: [1*r3,1*r3,3*r3,2*r3]

      Therefore to mix the columns in each word in the state we
      do the following (& 255 omitted for brevity):
      c'0,r0 = m0[c0 >> 24] ^ m1[c1 >> 16] ^ m2[c2 >> 8] ^ m3[c3]
      c'0,r1 = m0[c0 >> 24] ^ m1[c1 >> 16] ^ m2[c2 >> 8] ^ m3[c3]
      c'0,r2 = m0[c0 >> 24] ^ m1[c1 >> 16] ^ m2[c2 >> 8] ^ m3[c3]
      c'0,r3 = m0[c0 >> 24] ^ m1[c1 >> 16] ^ m2[c2 >> 8] ^ m3[c3]

      However, before mixing, the algorithm requires us to perform
      ShiftRows(). The ShiftRows() transformation cyclically shifts the
      last 3 rows of the state over different offsets. The first row
      (r = 0) is not shifted.

      s'_r,c = s_r,(c + shift(r, Nb) mod Nb
      for 0 < r < 4 and 0 <= c < Nb and
      shift(1, 4) = 1
      shift(2, 4) = 2
      shift(3, 4) = 3.

      This causes the first byte in r = 1 to be moved to the end of
      the row, the first 2 bytes in r = 2 to be moved to the end of
      the row, the first 3 bytes in r = 3 to be moved to the end of
      the row:

      r1: [c0 c1 c2 c3] => [c1 c2 c3 c0]
      r2: [c0 c1 c2 c3]    [c2 c3 c0 c1]
      r3: [c0 c1 c2 c3]    [c3 c0 c1 c2]

      We can make these substitutions inline with our column mixing to
      generate an updated set of equations to produce each word in the
      state (note the columns have changed positions):

      c0 c1 c2 c3 => c0 c1 c2 c3
      c0 c1 c2 c3    c1 c2 c3 c0  (cycled 1 byte)
      c0 c1 c2 c3    c2 c3 c0 c1  (cycled 2 bytes)
      c0 c1 c2 c3    c3 c0 c1 c2  (cycled 3 bytes)

      Therefore:

      c'0 = 2*r0,c0 + 3*r1,c1 + 1*r2,c2 + 1*r3,c3
      c'0 = 1*r0,c0 + 2*r1,c1 + 3*r2,c2 + 1*r3,c3
      c'0 = 1*r0,c0 + 1*r1,c1 + 2*r2,c2 + 3*r3,c3
      c'0 = 3*r0,c0 + 1*r1,c1 + 1*r2,c2 + 2*r3,c3

      c'1 = 2*r0,c1 + 3*r1,c2 + 1*r2,c3 + 1*r3,c0
      c'1 = 1*r0,c1 + 2*r1,c2 + 3*r2,c3 + 1*r3,c0
      c'1 = 1*r0,c1 + 1*r1,c2 + 2*r2,c3 + 3*r3,c0
      c'1 = 3*r0,c1 + 1*r1,c2 + 1*r2,c3 + 2*r3,c0

      ... and so forth for c'2 and c'3. The important distinction is
      that the columns are cycling, with c0 being used with the m0
      map when calculating c0, but c1 being used with the m0 map when
      calculating c1 ... and so forth.

      When performing the inverse we transform the mirror image and
      skip the bottom row, instead of the top one, and move upwards:

      c3 c2 c1 c0 => c0 c3 c2 c1  (cycled 3 bytes) *same as encryption
      c3 c2 c1 c0    c1 c0 c3 c2  (cycled 2 bytes)
      c3 c2 c1 c0    c2 c1 c0 c3  (cycled 1 byte)  *same as encryption
      c3 c2 c1 c0    c3 c2 c1 c0

      If you compare the resulting matrices for ShiftRows()+MixColumns()
      and for InvShiftRows()+InvMixColumns() the 2nd and 4th columns are
      different (in encrypt mode vs. decrypt mode). So in order to use
      the same code to handle both encryption and decryption, we will
      need to do some mapping.

      If in encryption mode we let a=c0, b=c1, c=c2, d=c3, and r<N> be
      a row number in the state, then the resulting matrix in encryption
      mode for applying the above transformations would be:

      r1: a b c d
      r2: b c d a
      r3: c d a b
      r4: d a b c

      If we did the same in decryption mode we would get:

      r1: a d c b
      r2: b a d c
      r3: c b a d
      r4: d c b a

      If instead we swap d and b (set b=c3 and d=c1), then we get:

      r1: a b c d
      r2: d a b c
      r3: c d a b
      r4: b c d a

      Now the 1st and 3rd rows are the same as the encryption matrix. All
      we need to do then to make the mapping exactly the same is to swap
      the 2nd and 4th rows when in decryption mode. To do this without
      having to do it on each iteration, we swapped the 2nd and 4th rows
      in the decryption key schedule. We also have to do the swap above
      when we first pull in the input and when we set the final output. */

  /* From: RFC3280 - Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate
    Section 6: Certification Path Validation
    See inline parentheticals related to this particular implementation.

    The primary goal of path validation is to verify the binding between
    a subject distinguished name or a subject alternative name and subject
    public key, as represented in the end entity certificate, based on the
    public key of the trust anchor. This requires obtaining a sequence of
    certificates that support that binding. That sequence should be provided
    in the passed 'chain'. The trust anchor should be in the given CA
    store. The 'end entity' certificate is the certificate provided by the
    end point (typically a server) and is the first in the chain.

    To meet this goal, the path validation process verifies, among other
    things, that a prospective certification path (a sequence of n
    certificates or a 'chain') satisfies the following conditions:

    (a) for all x in {1, ..., n-1}, the subject of certificate x is
          the issuer of certificate x+1;

    (b) certificate 1 is issued by the trust anchor;

    (c) certificate n is the certificate to be validated; and

    (d) for all x in {1, ..., n}, the certificate was valid at the
          time in question.

    Note that here 'n' is index 0 in the chain and 1 is the last certificate
    in the chain and it must be signed by a certificate in the connection's
    CA store.

    The path validation process also determines the set of certificate
    policies that are valid for this path, based on the certificate policies
    extension, policy mapping extension, policy constraints extension, and
    inhibit any-policy extension.

    Note: Policy mapping extension not supported (Not Required).

    Note: If the certificate has an unsupported critical extension, then it
    must be rejected.

    Note: A certificate is self-issued if the DNs that appear in the subject
    and issuer fields are identical and are not empty.

    The path validation algorithm assumes the following seven inputs are
    provided to the path processing logic. What this specific implementation
    will use is provided parenthetically:

    (a) a prospective certification path of length n (the 'chain')
    (b) the current date/time: ('now').
    (c) user-initial-policy-set: A set of certificate policy identifiers
          naming the policies that are acceptable to the certificate user.
          The user-initial-policy-set contains the special value any-policy
          if the user is not concerned about certificate policy
          (Not implemented. Any policy is accepted).
    (d) trust anchor information, describing a CA that serves as a trust
          anchor for the certification path. The trust anchor information
          includes:

      (1)  the trusted issuer name,
      (2)  the trusted public key algorithm,
      (3)  the trusted public key, and
      (4)  optionally, the trusted public key parameters associated
             with the public key.

      (Trust anchors are provided via certificates in the CA store).

      The trust anchor information may be provided to the path processing
      procedure in the form of a self-signed certificate. The trusted anchor
      information is trusted because it was delivered to the path processing
      procedure by some trustworthy out-of-band procedure. If the trusted
      public key algorithm requires parameters, then the parameters are
      provided along with the trusted public key (No parameters used in this
      implementation).

    (e) initial-policy-mapping-inhibit, which indicates if policy mapping is
          allowed in the certification path.
          (Not implemented, no policy checking)

    (f) initial-explicit-policy, which indicates if the path must be valid
          for at least one of the certificate policies in the user-initial-
          policy-set.
          (Not implemented, no policy checking)

    (g) initial-any-policy-inhibit, which indicates whether the
          anyPolicy OID should be processed if it is included in a
          certificate.
          (Not implemented, so any policy is valid provided that it is
          not marked as critical) */

  /* Basic Path Processing:

    For each certificate in the 'chain', the following is checked:

    1. The certificate validity period includes the current time.
    2. The certificate was signed by its parent (where the parent is either
       the next in the chain or from the CA store). Allow processing to
       continue to the next step if no parent is found but the certificate is
       in the CA store.
    3. TODO: The certificate has not been revoked.
    4. The certificate issuer name matches the parent's subject name.
    5. TODO: If the certificate is self-issued and not the final certificate
       in the chain, skip this step, otherwise verify that the subject name
       is within one of the permitted subtrees of X.500 distinguished names
       and that each of the alternative names in the subjectAltName extension
       (critical or non-critical) is within one of the permitted subtrees for
       that name type.
    6. TODO: If the certificate is self-issued and not the final certificate
       in the chain, skip this step, otherwise verify that the subject name
       is not within one of the excluded subtrees for X.500 distinguished
       names and none of the subjectAltName extension names are excluded for
       that name type.
    7. The other steps in the algorithm for basic path processing involve
       handling the policy extension which is not presently supported in this
       implementation. Instead, if a critical policy extension is found, the
       certificate is rejected as not supported.
    8. If the certificate is not the first or if its the only certificate in
       the chain (having no parent from the CA store or is self-signed) and it
       has a critical key usage extension, verify that the keyCertSign bit is
       set. If the key usage extension exists, verify that the basic
       constraints extension exists. If the basic constraints extension exists,
       verify that the cA flag is set. If pathLenConstraint is set, ensure that
       the number of certificates that precede in the chain (come earlier
       in the chain as implemented below), excluding the very first in the
       chain (typically the end-entity one), isn't greater than the
       pathLenConstraint. This constraint limits the number of intermediate
       CAs that may appear below a CA before only end-entity certificates
       may be issued. */

/**
 * Creates a token that can be used in a DI Provider.
 *
 * Use an `InjectionToken` whenever the type you are injecting is not reified (does not have a
 * runtime representation) such as when injecting an interface, callable type, array or
 * parameterized type.
 *
 * `InjectionToken` is parameterized on `T` which is the type of object which will be returned by
 * the `Injector`. This provides additional level of type safety.
 *
 * ```
 * interface MyInterface {...}
 * var myInterface = injector.get(new InjectionToken<MyInterface>('SomeToken'));
 * // myInterface is inferred to be MyInterface.
 * ```
 *
 * When creating an `InjectionToken`, you can optionally specify a factory function which returns
 * (possibly by creating) a default value of the parameterized type `T`. This sets up the
 * `InjectionToken` using this factory as a provider as if it was defined explicitly in the
 * application's root injector. If the factory function, which takes zero arguments, needs to inject
 * dependencies, it can do so using the `inject` function. See below for an example.
 *
 * Additionally, if a `factory` is specified you can also specify the `providedIn` option, which
 * overrides the above behavior and marks the token as belonging to a particular `@NgModule`. As
 * mentioned above, `'root'` is the default value for `providedIn`.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 * ### Basic Example
 *
 * ### Plain InjectionToken
 *
 * {@example core/di/ts/injector_spec.ts region='InjectionToken'}
 *
 * ### Tree-shakable InjectionToken
 *

/**
 * A pattern that recognizes a commonly useful subset of URLs that are safe.
 *
 * This regular expression matches a subset of URLs that will not cause script
 * execution if used in URL context within a HTML document. Specifically, this
 * regular expression matches if (comment from here on and regex copied from
 * Soy's EscapingConventions):
 * (1) Either an allowed protocol (http, https, mailto or ftp).
 * (2) or no protocol.  A protocol must be followed by a colon. The below
 *     allows that by allowing colons only after one of the characters [/?#].
 *     A colon after a hash (#) must be in the fragment.
 *     Otherwise, a colon after a (?) must be in a query.
 *     Otherwise, a colon after a single solidus (/) must be in a path.
 *     Otherwise, a colon after a double solidus (//) must be in the authority
 *     (before port).
 *
 * The pattern disallows &, used in HTML entity declarations before
 * one of the characters in [/?#]. This disallows HTML entities used in the
 * protocol name, which should never happen, e.g. "h&#116;tp" for "http".
 * It also disallows HTML entities in the first path part of a relative path,
 * e.g. "foo&lt;bar/baz".  Our existing escaping functions should not produce
 * that. More importantly, it disallows masking of a colon,
 * e.g. "javascript&#58;...".

 *
 * This file contains code to link styling instructions together so that they can be replayed in

 *             [style.color]=" #002 "

 *     ɵɵstyleMap({color: '#003'});
 *     ɵɵstyleProp('color', '#004');
 *     ...
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The Order of instruction execution is:
 *
 * NOTE: the comment binding location is for illustrative purposes only.
 *
 * ```
 * // Template: (ExampleComponent)
 *     ɵɵstyleMap({color: '#001'});   // Binding index: 10
 *     ɵɵstyleProp('color', '#002');  // Binding index: 12

 * // Style2Directive
 *     ɵɵstyleMap({color: '#007'});   // Binding index: 28
 *     ɵɵstyleProp('color', '#008');  // Binding index: 30
 * ```
 *
 * The correct priority order of concatenation is:
 *
 * ```
 * // MyComponent
 *     ɵɵstyleMap({color: '#003'});   // Binding index: 20
 *     ɵɵstyleProp('color', '#004');  // Binding index: 22
 * // Style1Directive
 *     ɵɵstyleMap({color: '#005'});   // Binding index: 24
 *     ɵɵstyleProp('color', '#006');  // Binding index: 26
 * // Style2Directive
 *     ɵɵstyleMap({color: '#007'});   // Binding index: 28
 *     ɵɵstyleProp('color', '#008');  // Binding index: 30
 * // Template: (ExampleComponent)
 *     ɵɵstyleMap({color: '#001'});   // Binding index: 10
 *     ɵɵstyleProp('color', '#002');  // Binding index: 12
 * ```
 *
 * What color should be rendered?
 *
 * Once the items are correctly sorted in the list, the answer is simply the last item in the
 * concatenation list which is `#002`.
 *
 * To do so we keep a linked list of all of the bindings which pertain to this element.
 * Notice that the bindings are inserted in the order of execution, but the `TView.data` allows
 * us to traverse them in the order of priority.
 *
 * |Idx|`TView.data`|`LView`          | Notes

 *
 * The above data structure allows us to re-concatenate the styling no matter which data binding
 * changes.
 *
 * NOTE: in addition to keeping track of next/previous index the `TView.data` also stores prev/next
 * duplicate bit. The duplicate bit if true says there either is a binding with the same name or
 * there is a map (which may contain the name). This information is useful in knowing if other
 * styles with higher priority need to be searched for overwrites.
 *
 * NOTE: See `should support example in 'tnode_linked_list.ts' documentation` in

 * ```

 * Add `tNode` to `previousTNodes` list and update relevant `TNode`s in `previousTNodes` list

 *
 * Things to keep in mind:
 * 1. All i18n text nodes are encoded as `TNodeType.Element` and are created eagerly by the
 *    `ɵɵi18nStart` instruction.
 * 2. All `TNodeType.Placeholder` `TNodes` are elements which will be created later by
 *    `ɵɵelementStart` instruction.
 * 3. `ɵɵelementStart` instruction will create `TNode`s in the ascending `TNode.index` order. (So a
 *    smaller index `TNode` is guaranteed to be created before a larger one)
 *
 * We use the above three invariants to determine `TNode.insertBeforeIndex`.
 *
 * In an ideal world `TNode.insertBeforeIndex` would always be `TNode.next.index`. However,
 * this will not work because `TNode.next.index` may be larger than `TNode.index` which means that
 * the next node is not yet created and therefore we can't insert in front of it.
 *
 * Rule1: `TNode.insertBeforeIndex = null` if `TNode.next === null` (Initial condition, as we don't
 *        know if there will be further `TNode`s inserted after.)
 * Rule2: If `previousTNode` is created after the `tNode` being inserted, then
 *        `previousTNode.insertBeforeNode = tNode.index` (So when a new `tNode` is added we check
 *        previous to see if we can update its `insertBeforeTNode`)
 *
 * See `TNode.insertBeforeIndex` for more context.
 *
 * @param previousTNodes A list of previous TNodes so that we can easily traverse `TNode`s in
 *     reverse order. (If `TNode` would have `previous` this would not be necessary.)

 * The following examples demonstrate how to modify default change-detection behavior
 * to perform explicit detection when needed.
 *
 * ### Use `markForCheck()` with `CheckOnce` strategy
 *
 * The following example sets the `OnPush` change-detection strategy for a component
 * (`CheckOnce`, rather than the default `CheckAlways`), then forces a second check
 * after an interval. See [live demo](https://plnkr.co/edit/GC512b?p=preview).
 *
 * <code-example path="core/ts/change_detect/change-detection.ts"
 * region="mark-for-check"></code-example>
 *
 * ### Detach change detector to limit how often check occurs
 *
 * The following example defines a component with a large list of read-only data
 * that is expected to change constantly, many times per second.
 * To improve performance, we want to check and update the list
 * less often than the changes actually occur. To do that, we detach
 * the component's change detector and perform an explicit local check every five seconds.
 *
 * <code-example path="core/ts/change_detect/change-detection.ts" region="detach"></code-example>
 *
 *
 * ### Reattaching a detached component
 *
 * The following example creates a component displaying live data.
 * The component detaches its change detector from the main change detector tree
 * when the `live` property is set to false, and reattaches it when the property
 * becomes true.

// This function calls the ngAfterContentCheck, ngAfterContentInit,
// ngAfterViewCheck, and ngAfterViewInit lifecycle hooks (depending on the node
// flags in lifecycle). Unlike ngDoCheck, ngOnChanges and ngOnInit, which are
// called during a pre-order traversal of the view tree (that is calling the
// parent hooks before the child hooks) these events are sent in using a
// post-order traversal of the tree (children before parents). This changes the
// meaning of initIndex in the view state. For ngOnInit, initIndex tracks the
// expected nodeIndex which a ngOnInit should be called. When sending
// ngAfterContentInit and ngAfterViewInit it is the expected count of
// ngAfterContentInit or ngAfterViewInit methods that have been called. This
// ensure that despite being called recursively or after picking up after an
// exception, the ngAfterContentInit or ngAfterViewInit will be called on the
// correct nodes. Consider for example, the following (where E is an element
// and D is a directive)
//  Tree:       pre-order index  post-order index
//    E1        0                6
//      E2      1                1
//       D3     2                0
//      E4      3                5
//       E5     4                4
//        E6    5                2
//        E7    6                3
// As can be seen, the post-order index has an unclear relationship to the
// pre-order index (postOrderIndex === preOrderIndex - parentCount +
// childCount). Since number of calls to ngAfterContentInit and ngAfterViewInit
// are stable (will be the same for the same view regardless of exceptions or
// recursion) we just need to count them which will roughly correspond to the
// post-order index (it skips elements and directives that do not have
// lifecycle hooks).
//
// For example, if an exception is raised in the E6.onAfterViewInit() the
// initIndex is left at 3 (by shouldCallLifecycleInitHook() which set it to
// initIndex + 1). When checkAndUpdateView() is called again D3, E2 and E6 will
// not have their ngAfterViewInit() called but, starting with E7, the rest of
// the view will begin getting ngAfterViewInit() called until a check and
// pass is complete.
//
// This algorthim also handles recursion. Consider if E4's ngAfterViewInit()
// indirectly calls E1's ChangeDetectorRef.detectChanges(). The expected
// initIndex is set to 6, the recusive checkAndUpdateView() starts walk again.
// D3, E2, E6, E7, E5 and E4 are skipped, ngAfterViewInit() is called on E1.
// When the recursion returns the initIndex will be 7 so E1 is skipped as it
// has already been called in the recursively called checkAnUpdateView().

/**
 * A reference to an Angular application running on a page.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 *
 * {@a is-stable-examples}
 * ### isStable examples and caveats
 *
 * Note two important points about `isStable`, demonstrated in the examples below:
 * - the application will never be stable if you start any kind
 * of recurrent asynchronous task when the application starts
 * (for example for a polling process, started with a `setInterval`, a `setTimeout`
 * or using RxJS operators like `interval`);
 * - the `isStable` Observable runs outside of the Angular zone.
 *
 * Let's imagine that you start a recurrent task
 * (here incrementing a counter, using RxJS `interval`),
 * and at the same time subscribe to `isStable`.
 *
 * ```
 * constructor(appRef: ApplicationRef) {
 *   appRef.isStable.pipe(
 *      filter(stable => stable)
 *   ).subscribe(() => console.log('App is stable now');
 *   interval(1000).subscribe(counter => console.log(counter));
 * }
 * ```
 * In this example, `isStable` will never emit `true`,
 * and the trace "App is stable now" will never get logged.
 *
 * If you want to execute something when the app is stable,
 * you have to wait for the application to be stable
 * before starting your polling process.
 *
 * ```
 * constructor(appRef: ApplicationRef) {
 *   appRef.isStable.pipe(
 *     first(stable => stable),
 *     tap(stable => console.log('App is stable now')),
 *     switchMap(() => interval(1000))
 *   ).subscribe(counter => console.log(counter));
 * }
 * ```
 * In this example, the trace "App is stable now" will be logged
 * and then the counter starts incrementing every second.
 *
 * Note also that this Observable runs outside of the Angular zone,
 * which means that the code in the subscription
 * to this Observable will not trigger the change detection.
 *
 * Let's imagine that instead of logging the counter value,
 * you update a field of your component
 * and display it in its template.
 *
 * ```
 * constructor(appRef: ApplicationRef) {
 *   appRef.isStable.pipe(
 *     first(stable => stable),
 *     switchMap(() => interval(1000))
 *   ).subscribe(counter => this.value = counter);
 * }
 * ```
 * As the `isStable` Observable runs outside the zone,
 * the `value` field will be updated properly,
 * but the template will not be refreshed!
 *
 * You'll have to manually trigger the change detection to update the template.
 *
 * ```
 * constructor(appRef: ApplicationRef, cd: ChangeDetectorRef) {
 *   appRef.isStable.pipe(
 *     first(stable => stable),
 *     switchMap(() => interval(1000))
 *   ).subscribe(counter => {
 *     this.value = counter;
 *     cd.detectChanges();
 *   });
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Or make the subscription callback run inside the zone.
 *
 * ```
 * constructor(appRef: ApplicationRef, zone: NgZone) {
 *   appRef.isStable.pipe(
 *     first(stable => stable),
 *     switchMap(() => interval(1000))
 *   ).subscribe(counter => zone.run(() => this.value = counter));
 * }
 * ```

/**
 * Represents an Angular [view](guide/glossary#view) in a view container.
 * An [embedded view](guide/glossary#view-tree) can be referenced from a component
 * other than the hosting component whose template defines it, or it can be defined
 * independently by a `TemplateRef`.
 *
 * Properties of elements in a view can change, but the structure (number and order) of elements in
 * a view cannot. Change the structure of elements by inserting, moving, or
 * removing nested views in a view container.
 *
 * @see `ViewContainerRef`
 *
 * @usageNotes
 *
 * The following template breaks down into two separate `TemplateRef` instances,
 * an outer one and an inner one.
 *
 * ```
 * Count: {{items.length}}
 * <ul>
 *   <li *ngFor="let  item of items">{{item}}</li>
 * </ul>
 * ```
 *
 * This is the outer `TemplateRef`:
 *
 * ```
 * Count: {{items.length}}
 * <ul>
 *   <ng-template ngFor let-item [ngForOf]="items"></ng-template>
 * </ul>
 * ```
 *
 * This is the inner `TemplateRef`:
 *
 * ```
 *   <li>{{item}}</li>
 * ```
 *
 * The outer and inner `TemplateRef` instances are assembled into views as follows:
 *
 * ```
 * <!-- ViewRef: outer-0 -->
 * Count: 2
 * <ul>
 *   <ng-template view-container-ref></ng-template>
 *   <!-- ViewRef: inner-1 --><li>first</li><!-- /ViewRef: inner-1 -->
 *   <!-- ViewRef: inner-2 --><li>second</li><!-- /ViewRef: inner-2 -->
 * </ul>
 * <!-- /ViewRef: outer-0 -->
 * ```

/**
 * Javascript implementation of Abstract Syntax Notation Number One.
 *
 * @author Dave Longley
 *
 * Copyright (c) 2010-2015 Digital Bazaar, Inc.
 *
 * An API for storing data using the Abstract Syntax Notation Number One
 * format using DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules) encoding. This encoding is
 * commonly used to store data for PKI, i.e. X.509 Certificates, and this
 * implementation exists for that purpose.
 *
 * Abstract Syntax Notation Number One (ASN.1) is used to define the abstract
 * syntax of information without restricting the way the information is encoded
 * for transmission. It provides a standard that allows for open systems
 * communication. ASN.1 defines the syntax of information data and a number of
 * simple data types as well as a notation for describing them and specifying
 * values for them.
 *
 * The RSA algorithm creates public and private keys that are often stored in
 * X.509 or PKCS#X formats -- which use ASN.1 (encoded in DER format). This
 * class provides the most basic functionality required to store and load DSA
 * keys that are encoded according to ASN.1.
 *
 * The most common binary encodings for ASN.1 are BER (Basic Encoding Rules)
 * and DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules). DER is just a subset of BER that
 * has stricter requirements for how data must be encoded.
 *
 * Each ASN.1 structure has a tag (a byte identifying the ASN.1 structure type)
 * and a byte array for the value of this ASN1 structure which may be data or a
 * list of ASN.1 structures.
 *
 * Each ASN.1 structure using BER is (Tag-Length-Value):
 *

 *
 * ASN.1 allows for tags to be of "High-tag-number form" which allows a tag to
 * be two or more octets, but that is not supported by this class. A tag is
 * only 1 byte. Bits 1-5 give the tag number (ie the data type within a
 * particular 'class'), 6 indicates whether or not the ASN.1 value is
 * constructed from other ASN.1 values, and bits 7 and 8 give the 'class'. If
 * bits 7 and 8 are both zero, the class is UNIVERSAL. If only bit 7 is set,
 * then the class is APPLICATION. If only bit 8 is set, then the class is
 * CONTEXT_SPECIFIC. If both bits 7 and 8 are set, then the class is PRIVATE.
 * The tag numbers for the data types for the class UNIVERSAL are listed below:
 *
 * UNIVERSAL 0 Reserved for use by the encoding rules
 * UNIVERSAL 1 Boolean type
 * UNIVERSAL 2 Integer type
 * UNIVERSAL 3 Bitstring type
 * UNIVERSAL 4 Octetstring type
 * UNIVERSAL 5 Null type
 * UNIVERSAL 6 Object identifier type
 * UNIVERSAL 7 Object descriptor type
 * UNIVERSAL 8 External type and Instance-of type
 * UNIVERSAL 9 Real type
 * UNIVERSAL 10 Enumerated type
 * UNIVERSAL 11 Embedded-pdv type
 * UNIVERSAL 12 UTF8String type
 * UNIVERSAL 13 Relative object identifier type
 * UNIVERSAL 14-15 Reserved for future editions
 * UNIVERSAL 16 Sequence and Sequence-of types
 * UNIVERSAL 17 Set and Set-of types
 * UNIVERSAL 18-22, 25-30 Character string types
 * UNIVERSAL 23-24 Time types
 *
 * The length of an ASN.1 structure is specified after the tag identifier.
 * There is a definite form and an indefinite form. The indefinite form may
 * be used if the encoding is constructed and not all immediately available.
 * The indefinite form is encoded using a length byte with only the 8th bit
 * set. The end of the constructed object is marked using end-of-contents
 * octets (two zero bytes).
 *
 * The definite form looks like this:
 *
 * The length may take up 1 or more bytes, it depends on the length of the
 * value of the ASN.1 structure. DER encoding requires that if the ASN.1
 * structure has a value that has a length greater than 127, more than 1 byte
 * will be used to store its length, otherwise just one byte will be used.
 * This is strict.
 *
 * In the case that the length of the ASN.1 value is less than 127, 1 octet
 * (byte) is used to store the "short form" length. The 8th bit has a value of
 * 0 indicating the length is "short form" and not "long form" and bits 7-1
 * give the length of the data. (The 8th bit is the left-most, most significant
 * bit: also known as big endian or network format).
 *
 * In the case that the length of the ASN.1 value is greater than 127, 2 to
 * 127 octets (bytes) are used to store the "long form" length. The first
 * byte's 8th bit is set to 1 to indicate the length is "long form." Bits 7-1
 * give the number of additional octets. All following octets are in base 256
 * with the most significant digit first (typical big-endian binary unsigned
 * integer storage). So, for instance, if the length of a value was 257, the
 * first byte would be set to:
 *
 * 10000010 = 130 = 0x82.
 *
 * This indicates there are 2 octets (base 256) for the length. The second and
 * third bytes (the octets just mentioned) would store the length in base 256:
 *
 * octet 2: 00000001 = 1 * 256^1 = 256
 * octet 3: 00000001 = 1 * 256^0 = 1
 * total = 257
 *
 * The algorithm for converting a js integer value of 257 to base-256 is:
 *
 * var value = 257;
 * var bytes = [];
 * bytes[0] = (value >>> 8) & 0xFF; // most significant byte first
 * bytes[1] = value & 0xFF;        // least significant byte last
 *
 * On the ASN.1 UNIVERSAL Object Identifier (OID) type:
 *
 * An OID can be written like: "value1.value2.value3...valueN"
 *
 * The DER encoding rules:
 *
 * The first byte has the value 40 * value1 + value2.
 * The following bytes, if any, encode the remaining values. Each value is
 * encoded in base 128, most significant digit first (big endian), with as
 * few digits as possible, and the most significant bit of each byte set
 * to 1 except the last in each value's encoding. For example: Given the
 * OID "1.2.840.113549", its DER encoding is (remember each byte except the
 * last one in each encoding is OR'd with 0x80):
 *
 * byte 1: 40 * 1 + 2 = 42 = 0x2A.
 * bytes 2-3: 128 * 6 + 72 = 840 = 6 72 = 6 72 = 0x0648 = 0x8648
 * bytes 4-6: 16384 * 6 + 128 * 119 + 13 = 6 119 13 = 0x06770D = 0x86F70D
 *
 * The final value is: 0x2A864886F70D.
 * The full OID (including ASN.1 tag and length of 6 bytes) is:
 * 0x06062A864886F70D

/**
 * DomSanitizer helps preventing Cross Site Scripting Security bugs (XSS) by sanitizing
 * values to be safe to use in the different DOM contexts.
 *
 * For example, when binding a URL in an `<a [href]="someValue">` hyperlink, `someValue` will be
 * sanitized so that an attacker cannot inject e.g. a `javascript:` URL that would execute code on
 * the website.
 *
 * In specific situations, it might be necessary to disable sanitization, for example if the
 * application genuinely needs to produce a `javascript:` style link with a dynamic value in it.
 * Users can bypass security by constructing a value with one of the `bypassSecurityTrust...`
 * methods, and then binding to that value from the template.
 *
 * These situations should be very rare, and extraordinary care must be taken to avoid creating a
 * Cross Site Scripting (XSS) security bug!
 *
 * When using `bypassSecurityTrust...`, make sure to call the method as early as possible and as
 * close as possible to the source of the value, to make it easy to verify no security bug is
 * created by its use.
 *
 * It is not required (and not recommended) to bypass security if the value is safe, e.g. a URL that
 * does not start with a suspicious protocol, or an HTML snippet that does not contain dangerous
 * code. The sanitizer leaves safe values intact.
 *
 * @security Calling any of the `bypassSecurityTrust...` APIs disables Angular's built-in
 * sanitization for the value passed in. Carefully check and audit all values and code paths going
 * into this call. Make sure any user data is appropriately escaped for this security context.
 * For more detail, see the [Security Guide](https://g.co/ng/security).

 * Instantiates a single {@link Component} type and inserts its Host View into current View.
 * `NgComponentOutlet` provides a declarative approach for dynamic component creation.
 *
 * `NgComponentOutlet` requires a component type, if a falsy value is set the view will clear and
 * any existing component will get destroyed.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 *
 * ### Fine tune control
 *
 * You can control the component creation process by using the following optional attributes:
 *
 * * `ngComponentOutletInjector`: Optional custom {@link Injector} that will be used as parent for
 * the Component. Defaults to the injector of the current view container.
 *
 * * `ngComponentOutletContent`: Optional list of projectable nodes to insert into the content
 * section of the component, if exists.
 *
 * * `ngComponentOutletNgModuleFactory`: Optional module factory to allow dynamically loading other
 * module, then load a component from that module.
 *
 * ### Syntax
 *
 * Simple
 * ```
 * <ng-container *ngComponentOutlet="componentTypeExpression"></ng-container>
 * ```
 *
 * Customized injector/content
 * ```
 * <ng-container *ngComponentOutlet="componentTypeExpression;
 *                                   injector: injectorExpression;
 *                                   content: contentNodesExpression;">
 * </ng-container>
 * ```
 *
 * Customized ngModuleFactory
 * ```
 * <ng-container *ngComponentOutlet="componentTypeExpression;
 *                                   ngModuleFactory: moduleFactory;">
 * </ng-container>
 * ```
 *
 * ### A simple example
 *
 * {@example common/ngComponentOutlet/ts/module.ts region='SimpleExample'}

/**
 * A [structural directive](guide/structural-directives) that renders
 * a template for each item in a collection.
 * The directive is placed on an element, which becomes the parent
 * of the cloned templates.
 *
 * The `ngForOf` directive is generally used in the
 * [shorthand form](guide/structural-directives#the-asterisk--prefix) `*ngFor`.
 * In this form, the template to be rendered for each iteration is the content
 * of an anchor element containing the directive.
 *
 * The following example shows the shorthand syntax with some options,
 * contained in an `<li>` element.
 *
 * ```
 * <li *ngFor="let item of items; index as i; trackBy: trackByFn">...</li>
 * ```
 *
 * The shorthand form expands into a long form that uses the `ngForOf` selector
 * on an `<ng-template>` element.
 * The content of the `<ng-template>` element is the `<li>` element that held the
 * short-form directive.
 *
 * Here is the expanded version of the short-form example.
 *
 * ```
 * <ng-template ngFor let-item [ngForOf]="items" let-i="index" [ngForTrackBy]="trackByFn">
 *   <li>...</li>
 * </ng-template>
 * ```
 *
 * Angular automatically expands the shorthand syntax as it compiles the template.
 * The context for each embedded view is logically merged to the current component
 * context according to its lexical position.
 *
 * When using the shorthand syntax, Angular allows only [one structural directive
 * on an element](guide/structural-directives#one-structural-directive-per-host-element).
 * If you want to iterate conditionally, for example,
 * put the `*ngIf` on a container element that wraps the `*ngFor` element.
 * For futher discussion, see
 * [Structural Directives](guide/structural-directives#one-per-element).
 *
 * @usageNotes
 *
 * ### Local variables
 *
 * `NgForOf` provides exported values that can be aliased to local variables.
 * For example:
 *
 *  ```
 * <li *ngFor="let user of users; index as i; first as isFirst">
 *    {{i}}/{{users.length}}. {{user}} <span *ngIf="isFirst">default</span>
 * </li>
 * ```
 *
 * The following exported values can be aliased to local variables:
 *
 * - `$implicit: T`: The value of the individual items in the iterable (`ngForOf`).
 * - `ngForOf: NgIterable<T>`: The value of the iterable expression. Useful when the expression is
 * more complex then a property access, for example when using the async pipe (`userStreams |
 * async`).
 * - `index: number`: The index of the current item in the iterable.
 * - `count: number`: The length of the iterable.
 * - `first: boolean`: True when the item is the first item in the iterable.
 * - `last: boolean`: True when the item is the last item in the iterable.
 * - `even: boolean`: True when the item has an even index in the iterable.
 * - `odd: boolean`: True when the item has an odd index in the iterable.
 *
 * ### Change propagation
 *
 * When the contents of the iterator changes, `NgForOf` makes the corresponding changes to the DOM:
 *
 * * When an item is added, a new instance of the template is added to the DOM.
 * * When an item is removed, its template instance is removed from the DOM.
 * * When items are reordered, their respective templates are reordered in the DOM.
 *
 * Angular uses object identity to track insertions and deletions within the iterator and reproduce
 * those changes in the DOM. This has important implications for animations and any stateful
 * controls that are present, such as `<input>` elements that accept user input. Inserted rows can
 * be animated in, deleted rows can be animated out, and unchanged rows retain any unsaved state
 * such as user input.
 * For more on animations, see [Transitions and Triggers](guide/transition-and-triggers).
 *
 * The identities of elements in the iterator can change while the data does not.
 * This can happen, for example, if the iterator is produced from an RPC to the server, and that
 * RPC is re-run. Even if the data hasn't changed, the second response produces objects with
 * different identities, and Angular must tear down the entire DOM and rebuild it (as if all old
 * elements were deleted and all new elements inserted).
 *
 * To avoid this expensive operation, you can customize the default tracking algorithm.
 * by supplying the `trackBy` option to `NgForOf`.
 * `trackBy` takes a function that has two arguments: `index` and `item`.
 * If `trackBy` is given, Angular tracks changes by the return value of the function.

/**
 * A structural directive that conditionally includes a template based on the value of
 * an expression coerced to Boolean.
 * When the expression evaluates to true, Angular renders the template
 * provided in a `then` clause, and when  false or null,
 * Angular renders the template provided in an optional `else` clause. The default
 * template for the `else` clause is blank.
 *
 * A [shorthand form](guide/structural-directives#the-asterisk--prefix) of the directive,
 * `*ngIf="condition"`, is generally used, provided
 * as an attribute of the anchor element for the inserted template.
 * Angular expands this into a more explicit version, in which the anchor element
 * is contained in an `<ng-template>` element.
 *
 * Simple form with shorthand syntax:
 *
 * ```
 * <div *ngIf="condition">Content to render when condition is true.</div>
 * ```
 *
 * Simple form with expanded syntax:
 *
 * ```
 * <ng-template [ngIf]="condition"><div>Content to render when condition is
 * true.</div></ng-template>
 * ```
 *
 * Form with an "else" block:
 *
 * ```
 * <div *ngIf="condition; else elseBlock">Content to render when condition is true.</div>
 * <ng-template #elseBlock>Content to render when condition is false.</ng-template>
 * ```
 *
 * Shorthand form with "then" and "else" blocks:
 *
 * ```
 * <div *ngIf="condition; then thenBlock else elseBlock"></div>
 * <ng-template #thenBlock>Content to render when condition is true.</ng-template>
 * <ng-template #elseBlock>Content to render when condition is false.</ng-template>
 * ```
 *
 * Form with storing the value locally:
 *
 * ```
 * <div *ngIf="condition as value; else elseBlock">{{value}}</div>
 * <ng-template #elseBlock>Content to render when value is null.</ng-template>
 * ```
 *
 * @usageNotes
 *
 * The `*ngIf` directive is most commonly used to conditionally show an inline template,
 * as seen in the following  example.
 * The default `else` template is blank.
 *
 * {@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfSimple'}
 *
 * ### Showing an alternative template using `else`
 *
 * To display a template when `expression` evaluates to false, use an `else` template
 * binding as shown in the following example.
 * The `else` binding points to an `<ng-template>`  element labeled `#elseBlock`.
 * The template can be defined anywhere in the component view, but is typically placed right after
 * `ngIf` for readability.
 *
 * {@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfElse'}
 *
 * ### Using an external `then` template
 *
 * In the previous example, the then-clause template is specified inline, as the content of the
 * tag that contains the `ngIf` directive. You can also specify a template that is defined
 * externally, by referencing a labeled `<ng-template>` element. When you do this, you can
 * change which template to use at runtime, as shown in the following example.
 *
 * {@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfThenElse'}
 *
 * ### Storing a conditional result in a variable
 *
 * You might want to show a set of properties from the same object. If you are waiting
 * for asynchronous data, the object can be undefined.
 * In this case, you can use `ngIf` and store the result of the condition in a local
 * variable as shown in the following example.
 *
 * {@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfAs'}
 *
 * This code uses only one `AsyncPipe`, so only one subscription is created.
 * The conditional statement stores the result of `userStream|async` in the local variable `user`.
 * You can then bind the local `user` repeatedly.
 *
 * The conditional displays the data only if `userStream` returns a value,
 * so you don't need to use the
 * safe-navigation-operator (`?.`)
 * to guard against null values when accessing properties.
 * You can display an alternative template while waiting for the data.
 *
 * ### Shorthand syntax
 *
 * The shorthand syntax `*ngIf` expands into two separate template specifications
 * for the "then" and "else" clauses. For example, consider the following shorthand statement,
 * that is meant to show a loading page while waiting for data to be loaded.
 *
 * ```
 * <div class="hero-list" *ngIf="heroes else loading">
 *  ...
 * </div>
 *
 * <ng-template #loading>
 *  <div>Loading...</div>
 * </ng-template>
 * ```
 *
 * You can see that the "else" clause references the `<ng-template>`
 * with the `#loading` label, and the template for the "then" clause
 * is provided as the content of the anchor element.
 *
 * However, when Angular expands the shorthand syntax, it creates
 * another `<ng-template>` tag, with `ngIf` and `ngIfElse` directives.
 * The anchor element containing the template for the "then" clause becomes
 * the content of this unlabeled `<ng-template>` tag.
 *
 * ```
 * <ng-template [ngIf]="heroes" [ngIfElse]="loading">
 *  <div class="hero-list">
 *   ...
 *  </div>
 * </ng-template>
 *
 * <ng-template #loading>
 *  <div>Loading...</div>
 * </ng-template>
 * ```
 *
 * The presence of the implicit template object has implications for the nesting of
 * structural directives. For more on this subject, see
 * [Structural Directives](https://angular.io/guide/structural-directives#one-per-element).

 * @description
 * The `[ngSwitch]` directive on a container specifies an expression to match against.
 * The expressions to match are provided by `ngSwitchCase` directives on views within the container.
 * - Every view that matches is rendered.
 * - If there are no matches, a view with the `ngSwitchDefault` directive is rendered.
 * - Elements within the `[NgSwitch]` statement but outside of any `NgSwitchCase`
 * or `ngSwitchDefault` directive are preserved at the location.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 * Define a container element for the directive, and specify the switch expression
 * to match against as an attribute:
 *
 * ```
 * <container-element [ngSwitch]="switch_expression">
 * ```
 *
 * Within the container, `*ngSwitchCase` statements specify the match expressions
 * as attributes. Include `*ngSwitchDefault` as the final case.
 *
 * ```
 * <container-element [ngSwitch]="switch_expression">
 *    <some-element *ngSwitchCase="match_expression_1">...</some-element>
 * ...
 *    <some-element *ngSwitchDefault>...</some-element>
 * </container-element>
 * ```
 *
 * ### Usage Examples
 *
 * The following example shows how to use more than one case to display the same view:
 *
 * ```
 * <container-element [ngSwitch]="switch_expression">
 *   <!-- the same view can be shown in more than one case -->
 *   <some-element *ngSwitchCase="match_expression_1">...</some-element>
 *   <some-element *ngSwitchCase="match_expression_2">...</some-element>
 *   <some-other-element *ngSwitchCase="match_expression_3">...</some-other-element>
 *   <!--default case when there are no matches -->
 *   <some-element *ngSwitchDefault>...</some-element>
 * </container-element>
 * ```
 *
 * The following example shows how cases can be nested:
 * ```
 * <container-element [ngSwitch]="switch_expression">
 *       <some-element *ngSwitchCase="match_expression_1">...</some-element>

 * @description
 *
 * Unwraps a value from an asynchronous primitive.
 *
 * The `async` pipe subscribes to an `Observable` or `Promise` and returns the latest value it has
 * emitted. When a new value is emitted, the `async` pipe marks the component to be checked for
 * changes. When the component gets destroyed, the `async` pipe unsubscribes automatically to avoid
 * potential memory leaks.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 *
 * ### Examples
 *
 * This example binds a `Promise` to the view. Clicking the `Resolve` button resolves the
 * promise.
 *
 * {@example common/pipes/ts/async_pipe.ts region='AsyncPipePromise'}
 *
 * It's also possible to use `async` with Observables. The example below binds the `time` Observable
 * to the view. The Observable continuously updates the view with the current time.
 *
 * {@example common/pipes/ts/async_pipe.ts region='AsyncPipeObservable'}

/**
 * @ngModule CommonModule
 * @description
 *
 * Formats a date value according to locale rules.
 *
 * Only the `en-US` locale data comes with Angular. To localize dates
 * in another language, you must import the corresponding locale data.
 * See the [I18n guide](guide/i18n#i18n-pipes) for more information.
 *
 * @see `formatDate()`
 *
 *
 * @usageNotes
 *
 * The result of this pipe is not reevaluated when the input is mutated. To avoid the need to
 * reformat the date on every change-detection cycle, treat the date as an immutable object
 * and change the reference when the pipe needs to run again.
 *
 * ### Pre-defined format options

 * ### Format examples
 *
 * These examples transform a date into various formats,
 * assuming that `dateObj` is a JavaScript `Date` object for
 * year: 2015, month: 6, day: 15, hour: 21, minute: 43, second: 11,
 * given in the local time for the `en-US` locale.
 *
 * ```
 * {{ dateObj | date }}               // output is 'Jun 15, 2015'
 * {{ dateObj | date:'medium' }}      // output is 'Jun 15, 2015, 9:43:11 PM'
 * {{ dateObj | date:'shortTime' }}   // output is '9:43 PM'
 * {{ dateObj | date:'mm:ss' }}       // output is '43:11'
 * ```
 *
 * ### Usage example
 *
 * The following component uses a date pipe to display the current date in different formats.
 *
 * ```
 * @Component({
 *  selector: 'date-pipe',
 *  template: `<div>
 *    <p>Today is {{today | date}}</p>
 *    <p>Or if you prefer, {{today | date:'fullDate'}}</p>
 *    <p>The time is {{today | date:'h:mm a z'}}</p>

    This data includes the message, some padding, and the length of the
    message. Since the length of the message will be encoded as 8 bytes (64
    bits), that means that the last segment of the data must have 56 bytes
    (448 bits) of message and padding. Therefore, the length of the message
    plus the padding must be congruent to 448 mod 512 because
    512 - 128 = 448.

    In order to fill up the message length it must be filled with
    padding that begins with 1 bit followed by all 0 bits. Padding
    must *always* be present, so if the message length is already

/**
 * See NIST SP-800-38D 6.3 (Algorithm 1). This function performs Galois

 *
 * x^128 + x^7 + x^2 + x + 1
 *
 * Which is represented in little-endian binary form as: 11100001 (0xe1). When
 * the value of a coefficient is 1, a bit is set. The value R, is the
 * concatenation of this value and 120 zero bits, yielding a 128-bit value
 * which matches the block size.
 *
 * This function will multiply two elements (vectors of bytes), X and Y, in
 * the field GF(2^128). The result is initialized to zero. For each bit of
 * X (out of 128), x_i, if x_i is set, then the result is multiplied (XOR'd)
 * by the current value of Y. For each bit, the value of Y will be raised by
 * a power of x (multiplied by the polynomial x). This can be achieved by
 * shifting Y once to the right. If the current value of Y, prior to being
 * multiplied by x, has 0 as its LSB, then it is a 127th degree polynomial.
 * Otherwise, we must divide by R after shifting to find the remainder.
 *

  /* Chinese remainder theorem (CRT) states:

    Suppose n1, n2, ..., nk are positive integers which are pairwise
    coprime (n1 and n2 have no common factors other than 1). For any
    integers x1, x2, ..., xk there exists an integer x solving the
    system of simultaneous congruences (where ~= means modularly
    congruent so a ~= b mod n means a mod n = b mod n):

    x ~= x1 mod n1
    x ~= x2 mod n2
    ...
    x ~= xk mod nk

    This system of congruences has a single simultaneous solution x
    between 0 and n - 1. Furthermore, each xk solution and x itself
    is congruent modulo the product n = n1*n2*...*nk.
    So x1 mod n = x2 mod n = xk mod n = x mod n.

    The single simultaneous solution x can be solved with the following
    equation:

    x = sum(xi*ri*si) mod n where ri = n/ni and si = ri^-1 mod ni.

    Where x is less than n, xi = x mod ni.

    For RSA we are only concerned with k = 2. The modulus n = pq, where
    p and q are coprime. The RSA decryption algorithm is:

    y = x^d mod n

    Given the above:

    x1 = x^d mod p
    r1 = n/p = q
    s1 = q^-1 mod p
    x2 = x^d mod q
    r2 = n/q = p
    s2 = p^-1 mod q

    So y = (x1r1s1 + x2r2s2) mod n
         = ((x^d mod p)q(q^-1 mod p) + (x^d mod q)p(p^-1 mod q)) mod n

    According to Fermat's Little Theorem, if the modulus P is prime,
    for any integer A not evenly divisible by P, A^(P-1) ~= 1 mod P.
    Since A is not divisible by P it follows that if:
    N ~= M mod (P - 1), then A^N mod P = A^M mod P. Therefore:

    A^N mod P = A^(M mod (P - 1)) mod P. (The latter takes less effort
    to calculate). In order to calculate x^d mod p more quickly the
    exponent d mod (p - 1) is stored in the RSA private key (the same
    is done for x^d mod q). These values are referred to as dP and dQ
    respectively. Therefore we now have:

    y = ((x^dP mod p)q(q^-1 mod p) + (x^dQ mod q)p(p^-1 mod q)) mod n

    Since we'll be reducing x^dP by modulo p (same for q) we can also
    reduce x by p (and q respectively) before hand. Therefore, let

    xp = ((x mod p)^dP mod p), and
    xq = ((x mod q)^dQ mod q), yielding:

    y = (xp*q*(q^-1 mod p) + xq*p*(p^-1 mod q)) mod n

    This can be further reduced to a simple algorithm that only
    requires 1 inverse (the q inverse is used) to be used and stored.
    The algorithm is called Garner's algorithm. If qInv is the
    inverse of q, we simply calculate:

    y = (qInv*(xp - xq) mod p) * q + xq

    However, there are two further complications. First, we need to
    ensure that xp > xq to prevent signed BigIntegers from being used
    so we add p until this is true (since we will be mod'ing with
    p anyway). Then, there is a known timing attack on algorithms
    using the CRT. To mitigate this risk, "cryptographic blinding"
    should be used. This requires simply generating a random number r
    between 0 and n-1 and its inverse and multiplying x by r^e before
    calculating y and then multiplying y by r^-1 afterwards. Note that
    r must be coprime with n (gcd(r, n) === 1) in order to have an
    inverse.
  */

/**
 * @description
 *
 * When applied to an element in a template, makes that element a link
 * that initiates navigation to a route. Navigation opens one or more routed components
 * in one or more `<router-outlet>` locations on the page.
 *
 * Given a route configuration `[{ path: 'user/:name', component: UserCmp }]`,
 * the following creates a static link to the route:
 * `<a routerLink="/user/bob">link to user component</a>`
 *
 * You can use dynamic values to generate the link.
 * For a dynamic link, pass an array of path segments,
 * followed by the params for each segment.
 * For example, `['/team', teamId, 'user', userName, {details: true}]`
 * generates a link to `/team/11/user/bob;details=true`.
 *
 * Multiple static segments can be merged into one term and combined with dynamic segements.
 * For example, `['/team/11/user', userName, {details: true}]`
 *
 * The input that you provide to the link is treated as a delta to the current URL.
 * For instance, suppose the current URL is `/user/(box//aux:team)`.
 * The link `<a [routerLink]="['/user/jim']">Jim</a>` creates the URL
 * `/user/(jim//aux:team)`.
 * See {@link Router#createUrlTree createUrlTree} for more information.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 *
 * You can use absolute or relative paths in a link, set query parameters,
 * control how parameters are handled, and keep a history of navigation states.
 *
 * ### Relative link paths
 *
 * The first segment name can be prepended with `/`, `./`, or `../`.
 * * If the first segment begins with `/`, the router looks up the route from the root of the
 *   app.
 * * If the first segment begins with `./`, or doesn't begin with a slash, the router
 *   looks in the children of the current activated route.
 * * If the first segment begins with `../`, the router goes up one level in the route tree.
 *
 * ### Setting and handling query params and fragments
 *
 * The following link adds a query parameter and a fragment to the generated URL:
 *
 * ```
 * <a [routerLink]="['/user/bob']" [queryParams]="{debug: true}" fragment="education">
 *   link to user component
 * </a>
 * ```
 * By default, the directive constructs the new URL using the given query parameters.
 * The example generates the link: `/user/bob?debug=true#education`.
 *
 * You can instruct the directive to handle query parameters differently
 * by specifying the `queryParamsHandling` option in the link.
 * Allowed values are:
 *
 *  - `'merge'`: Merge the given `queryParams` into the current query params.
 *  - `'preserve'`: Preserve the current query params.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * ```
 * <a [routerLink]="['/user/bob']" [queryParams]="{debug: true}" queryParamsHandling="merge">
 *   link to user component
 * </a>
 * ```
 *
 * See {@link UrlCreationOptions.queryParamsHandling UrlCreationOptions#queryParamsHandling}.
 *
 * ### Preserving navigation history
 *
 * You can provide a `state` value to be persisted to the browser's
 * [`History.state` property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History#Properties).
 * For example:
 *
 * ```
 * <a [routerLink]="['/user/bob']" [state]="{tracingId: 123}">
 *   link to user component
 * </a>
 * ```
 *
 * Use {@link Router.getCurrentNavigation() Router#getCurrentNavigation} to retrieve a saved
 * navigation-state value. For example, to capture the `tracingId` during the `NavigationStart`
 * event:
 *
 * ```
 * // Get NavigationStart events
 * router.events.pipe(filter(e => e instanceof NavigationStart)).subscribe(e => {
 *   const navigation = router.getCurrentNavigation();
 *   tracingService.trace({id: navigation.extras.state.tracingId});
 * });
 * ```

 * @description
 *
 * Tracks whether the linked route of an element is currently active, and allows you
 * to specify one or more CSS classes to add to the element when the linked route
 * is active.
 *
 * Use this directive to create a visual distinction for elements associated with an active route.
 * For example, the following code highlights the word "Bob" when the router
 * activates the associated route:
 *
 * ```
 * <a routerLink="/user/bob" routerLinkActive="active-link">Bob</a>
 * ```
 *
 * Whenever the URL is either '/user' or '/user/bob', the "active-link" class is
 * added to the anchor tag. If the URL changes, the class is removed.
 *
 * You can set more than one class using a space-separated string or an array.
 * For example:
 *
 * ```
 * <a routerLink="/user/bob" routerLinkActive="class1 class2">Bob</a>
 * <a routerLink="/user/bob" [routerLinkActive]="['class1', 'class2']">Bob</a>
 * ```
 *
 * To add the classes only when the URL matches the link exactly, add the option `exact: true`:
 *
 * ```
 * <a routerLink="/user/bob" routerLinkActive="active-link" [routerLinkActiveOptions]="{exact:
 * true}">Bob</a>
 * ```
 *
 * To directly check the `isActive` status of the link, assign the `RouterLinkActive`
 * instance to a template variable.
 * For example, the following checks the status without assigning any CSS classes:
 *
 * ```
 * <a routerLink="/user/bob" routerLinkActive #rla="routerLinkActive">
 *   Bob {{ rla.isActive ? '(already open)' : ''}}
 * </a>
 * ```
 *
 * You can apply the `RouterLinkActive` directive to an ancestor of linked elements.
 * For example, the following sets the active-link class on the `<div>`  parent tag
 * when the URL is either '/user/jim' or '/user/bob'.
 *
 * ```
 * <div routerLinkActive="active-link" [routerLinkActiveOptions]="{exact: true}">
 *   <a routerLink="/user/jim">Jim</a>
 *   <a routerLink="/user/bob">Bob</a>
 * </div>

 *
 * Acts as a placeholder that Angular dynamically fills based on the current router state.
 *
 * Each outlet can have a unique name, determined by the optional `name` attribute.
 * The name cannot be set or changed dynamically. If not set, default value is "primary".
 *
 * ```
 * <router-outlet></router-outlet>
 * <router-outlet name='left'></router-outlet>
 * <router-outlet name='right'></router-outlet>
 * ```
 *
 * Named outlets can be the targets of secondary routes.
 * The `Route` object for a secondary route has an `outlet` property to identify the target outlet:
 *
 * `{path: <base-path>, component: <component>, outlet: <target_outlet_name>}`
 *
 * Using named outlets and secondary routes, you can target multiple outlets in
 * the same `RouterLink` directive.
 *
 * The router keeps track of separate branches in a navigation tree for each named outlet and
 * generates a representation of that tree in the URL.
 * The URL for a secondary route uses the following syntax to specify both the primary and secondary
 * routes at the same time:
 *
 * `http://base-path/primary-route-path(outlet-name:route-path)`
 *
 * A router outlet emits an activate event when a new component is instantiated,
 * and a deactivate event when a component is destroyed.
 *
 * ```
 * <router-outlet
 *   (activate)='onActivate($event)'
 *   (deactivate)='onDeactivate($event)'></router-outlet>
 * ```
